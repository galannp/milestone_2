But big losses are emerging as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Carlien Scheele, director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).EIGE has been monitoring the advancement of gender equality throughout the European Union since 2013, measuring progress through six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power, and health.Every country is given a score from 0 to 100 on each domain.The results from this year were far from comforting: the EU scored 68 points out of 100 in this year\\'s Index -- a \"microscopic increase of just 0.6 points since last year’s edition,\" EIGE said.The agency has expressed concern about the slow pace of progress towards gender equality, with a mere increase of 4.9 points in total since 2010.And \"even that minimal progress on gender equality is threatened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the agency insisted.The report noted that women were over-represented among essential and frontline workers during the pandemic, and thus more exposed to infection. Men, meanwhile, were more likely to be hospitalised if they contracted the virus.The pandemic also impacted gender inequalities in the home, with women bearing the brunt of unpaid care work during repeated lockdowns.Experts have also observed a \"pandemic within the pandemic\" of domestic violence.\"Cohabitation brought about by lockdowns and economic and labour instability are considered stressors associated with an increase in intimate partner violence,\" the report noted, citing previous studies.The economic fallout of the pandemic is also \"lasting longer for women\", said Scheele.\"Our index findings can help Europe’s leaders tackle the different effects of the pandemic on women and men and alleviate the unequal short and long-term impact,” the EIGE director insisted.The new report highlighted wide disparities among EU countries on the road to gender equality.Sweden and Denmark retained their position as Europe\\'s top gender equality performers, with respectively 83.9 and 77.8 points.The two Scandinavian countries were followed by the Netherlands, which took over Finland and France to claim third place.\"Luxembourg, Lithuania, and the Netherlands have improved the most since last year’s edition,\" EIGE noted.\"Slovenia was the only country that went backwards.\"Share this articleLearn more aboutLearn more aboutShare this articleThe Gender Equality Index 2021 released today (Thursday) warns that the pandemic is threatening \"fragile gains\" made in Europe towards gender equality.\"Europe has made fragile gains in gender equality.

That\\'s now changed to \"short tight pants\", Euronews has learned.Men, meanwhile, are still asked to wear a tank top and shorts.Women\\'s uniforms for official beach handball competitions have for years been criticised as too degrading or too impractical.Denmark\\'s sports minister Ane Halsboe-Joergensen said rules were \"obsolete\" and \"belonged to another country\".\"It should be a free choice within standardised rules,\" added NHF president Kare Geir Lio.But it was not until Norway lined up for their July bronze medal match against Spain in shorts that global headlines were generated.The Norwegian Handball Federation (NHF) stated that it was prepared to pay the penalty of €150 per player for not wearing bikini bottoms that were \"close fit and cut on an upward angle toward the top of the leg\". However, the team gained tremendous support for their stance.And, after the widespread outcry, the IHF has now quietly altered its official policies on \"improper clothing\".By October 3, the official \"Rules of the Game\" for Beach Handball were indeed updated as below:Meanwhile, for cold or severe weather, female players are permitted -- as before -- to wear a tight shirt and \"long tight pants\". No change there.Accompanying graphics indicate the change in rules from 2014 to 2021.So female players are no longer required to wear low-cut bikini bottoms on the field without risking a fine.But if their uniforms must still be \"body fit\" and \"tight\" and there is no such rule for male players, do the new regulations satisfy the complaints?One of those who called on the IHF to make the change was Norway\\'s former Minister for Culture and Equality Abid Raja -- who has since left his government role.Raja had stated that the previous uniform policies for female beach handball players were \"completely ridiculous,\" \"clearly discriminating and outdated\".In a statement, the former minister said that the IHF needed to go further to achieve gender equality.\"I am glad that the International Handball Federation has listened to the broad criticism, both from the sport itself and from outsiders such as the Nordic Ministers of Sport, and decided to change the clothing requirement for beach handball players,\" Raja told Euronews.\"This being said, I would have wished that the International Handball Federation had taken the full step towards gender equality.\"Raja stated that the IHF should have omitted the requirement for female players to wear \"short tight pants\".\"I had rather seen that the Federation would listen to the female players themselves and ensured equal rules for male and female players,\" he told Euronews.The NHF has described the uniform change as a \"huge step in the right direction\" but they too stopped short of praising the new rules.\"It’s our view that it would have been even better if the rules consisted of one set of uniform regulations independent of gender,\" the authority said in a statement. Euronews has contacted the IHF for a response to Norway on the new rules.Share this articleShare this articleMPs in Albania on Friday approved the country’s new women-dominated cabinet.Following a 20-hour debate, the 140-seat parliament voted 77-53 for Prime Minister Edi Rama\\'s new cabinet and programme.The left-wing Socialist Party secured a record third consecutive mandate in an April 25 parliamentary election, with 74 seats. The centre-right Democratic Party got 59 seats in opposition.Rama, 57, boasted in his speech that \"this new government will enter history as the cabinet with the highest number of women\" — 12 in the 17-member cabinet, propelling Albania to the top of global rankings in terms of the percentage of women holding cabinet positions.According to the latest UN figures, dating from January 2021, Nicaragua topped the list at the time with 10 women among 17 cabinet members. Even then, Albania had ranked in 5th position with 9 women in a 16-strong cabinet.Rama has included women in top positions throughout his career, including during his tenures as culture minister, mayor of the Albanian capital Tirana, and as prime minister, a position he has held since 2013.However, Rama warned that no minister would be favoured due to their gender and that the length of their terms would depend solely on their performance in their posts, “without gender discrimination.”Independent analyst Lutfi Dervishi said the next move should be to have women in the top posts of president and prime minister, which he said would change the outer world\\'s view of Albania \"as a conservative society, or a mostly Islamic one run by corruption”.“There is a general perception that women are less inclined to corruption and abuse of post,” he added.But some noted the lack of experience of some of the new cabinet members. Independent analyst Aleksander Cipa said public opinion was critical as some of the new appointees “come from anonymity” and were not known for any noted professional success or political career.Rama has had “a constant preference in his political and executive career” with naming women to key positions around him, Cipa said, adding that this practice could be done in part for public relations reasons.“He has felt better (working with women) due to his individual authority and he is more controlling in partnership with governing ladies,” he said.The government\\'s main challenges will be completing the reconstruction process following the November 2019 earthquake and coping with the pandemic and its impact on the economy, as well as fighting corruption and drug trafficking, boosting growth to at least 4% annually, raising salaries and lowering unemployment.The prime minister aims to turn the country into an energy producer and exporter and to diversify energy with solar and wind products. Rama also wants to make Albania by 2030 \"an absolute champion of tourism in the Balkans\".Newcomer Delinda Ibrahimaj was appointed to run the country’s finance and economy portfolios. Olta Xhacka keeps her post of foreign minister, as do Culture Minister Elva Margariti and Education Minister Evis Kushi.Another newcomer, Frida Krifca, will run the Agriculture Ministry, with a goal of achieving $1 billion in agricultural products exports. The new parliament speaker is also a woman, Lindita Nikolla, a former education minister.Albania, with a population 2.8 million, has been a NATO member since 2009 and hopes to launch full membership negotiations with the European Union later this year.Share this articleShare this articleMPs in Albania on Friday approved the country’s new women-dominated cabinet.Following a 20-hour debate, the 140-seat parliament voted 77-53 for Prime Minister Edi Rama\\'s new cabinet and programme.The left-wing Socialist Party secured a record third consecutive mandate in an April 25 parliamentary election, with 74 seats.

They learnt team-building with a treasure hunt and were also able to brush up on their programming skills at one of Portugal’s most innovative coding schools.In all, 1225 European women applied for the Summer School for Female Leadership.

He coined a term which addresses so many issues of our time. Questions about gender stereotypes and the negative idea of the word feminine. A few years ago, I wrote a picture book based on this incident about a little boy who likes to knit and sew. He is teased at first but forging ahead and supported by his family and some adults, he earns the respect of others including his classmates, simply by being himself. The book is currently available in 12 countries and eight languages, thus implying the ideas and messages in the book span many cultures.As a young boy in the United States, I got a lot of attention because I could sing and dance, and I started working professionally around age 11. Coming from an observant religious background also set me apart from others. The support and joy it brought to those really close to me was immeasurable and certainly helped me to let anything negative roll off my back. But in our religious community, and the school I went to, these were unusual talents for boys to explore.Because I loved working as a child actor there wasn’t time to participate in sports like many young boys do. I didn\\'t feel particularly self-conscious because I was focused on what I was doing, but it appeared I wasn’t a part of the popular groups like “the jocks”. In retrospect, although I didn’t feel particularly lonely, there was a loneliness or isolation being so fixated on my work. I began to understand that everyone has felt different -- at odds with what is perceived to be normal at points in their life.If we start to understand and support that we are all individuals with our own special interests and personalities, we can find ways to not become victims to bullying or bad behavior which is usually an act of fear of the unknown.We have heard a lot in recent years about boys and men needing to be in touch with their feminine side. But what does that mean? Narrow expectations of gender are crushing both boys and girls.One of the interesting things I have found is that even the most progressive parent sometimes loses common sense. They may encourage their kids to follow an unorthodox path in the privacy of their home, but in public encourage them to conform. They don’t recognise how a child might be confused by this. As an example, I know parents who let their little boy wear high heels in the house but stop him from wearing them outside. What does this say to a child? How sad to imply that a child’s casual interests should be explored in secret. This does not prepare anyone for a life outside the home. Instead, we need to give them the tools to handle any issues that may come their way.Our job is to free our kids to be true to themselves. It is a process, and along the way, kids should be able to try on many different skins. Didn\\'t we all go through a growth period, stoner period, jock period, theatre kid period or even the newly popular geek-nerd period? It’s why we squirm when we see old photos of ourselves. That’s why some get nervous about a school reunion – our style and persona changes over time. Will anyone remember me as I was, or want to know me as the person I have become? By constantly commenting to kids on how they should act, what they wear and what their interests should be, we make it harder for them to develop.Play is where you dream and imagine different identities! We cannot protect kids from everything, nor should we. Of course, we should protect them from danger and violence, but they need life experiences in order to learn empathy and coexist in the world. If a child is sheltered in this way, they can become closed-minded and entitled, they are unable to relate to others, let alone those who are perceived as different.The secure child is permitted to explore and learn, to navigate a world in which they might be teased or bullied. I believe that bullying is part of our nature and will never be stopped. However, self-assurance will help a child, and adult, for that matter, fend off teasing or at the least help to let it roll off their back while they continue on their quest to becoming a whole person.Finally, I ask myself why is it that the idea of feminine is negative. As Gloria Steinem said, “We\\'ve begun to raise daughters more like sons... but few have the courage to raise our sons more like our daughters.”A tomboy is praised for being assertive and strong, but a boy perceived as acting like a girl is a problem. When you tell your son not to be “girly” what does that mean to his sister? What are little girls supposed to think when their activities or interests are publicly delegitimised?There is a huge difference between letting a girl play sports and pushing her to do something she has little interest in. I’m not specifically identifying sports as a problem, it’s just an example. Similarly, one shouldn’t quash the idea of a boy interested in ballet classes.How do we create a world where all of us can express our unique selves the way we choose without derisiveness and shame? I am not here to criticise the wonderful parents and caregivers who are reading this – they only love their children. Common sense must prevail. I only ask with respect that parents and caregivers let their kids explore freely so we all can find a way to live together with our differences celebrated.What a wonderful day that will be.Craig Pomranz is an American writer, actor, and singer-songwriter.

In this country, women have to ask their husband\\'s permission, even to visit their parents, otherwise, they can be repudiated. Considered for their physical beauty and the good management of their household, they have to keep a low profile to avoid cultural prejudice and violence.According to 2009 figures, women represent just over half of the population of Burundi. In a country where the economy is mainly rural, based on agriculture and livestock, Burundian women represent 55.2% of the 90% of the agricultural labour force. Agricultural production is divided between products for export, such as coffee, tea, and cotton, and food crops.However, despite their density, women are not sufficiently represented in decision-making at home and in the workplace. When a woman wants to enter politics, she has to ask her husband\\'s permission in order not to break up the household. Without inheritance rights, if she does not have a home, she can quickly be called \"shameless\".Located in the eastern part of the continent in the Great Lakes region and with a population of around 12 million, Burundi is one of the smallest countries in Africa. The country is landlocked and surrounded by the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west, Rwanda to the north, and Tanzania to the east and south. It is a country with a hot and humid tropical climate whose capital since 2019 is Gitega, the second-largest city in Burundi.It is also a country affected by gender inequality, which is largely explained by traditions and customs that discriminate against women in society. As a result, women are victims of all forms of violence.A study by Impunity Watch, an international human rights organisation, shows that 97% of victims of violence are women.This discrimination against women can be seen, for example, in the area of inheritance, where women have no right to inherit land. But also in the different language surrounding the role of women and men in society. For example, \"a woman cannot speak in the presence of a man.\"Today, many Burundians are aware of this discrimination and are committed to fighting against gender inequalities for better social cohesion.Please find below a series of photos where you will see images of traditional Burundian rural men and women in the provinces of Ngozi, Kirundo (Ntega), Kayanza, and in Bujumbura.

But she says creating music is also a way for her to escape her personal trauma. It’s her creative coping mechanism after everything that she and the country have been through.“There\\'s so much in Liberia that we’ve been through,” she says.“From the war to domestic violence, to rape, to sex. I just can\\'t name it all. It can even traumatise you when you just start to think about it.”After two civil wars, the last ended in 2003, Liberian society has had to come to grips with the loss of family, sexual and domestic violence and PTSD. But Liberians have had little time to heal their scars. In 2014, the country faced a tragic Ebola outbreak for over two years. They are now dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.We’re speaking on a Zoom call. FaithVonic is wearing a necklace with a charm that is shaped like the continent of Africa, and she just posted a photo on Instagram about the beauty of being a Liberian. Her answer: the Koloqau (local language), food, fun and the people.“We have many problems, but I\\'m trying to take people’s minds off it, like forget about the problems for once and just identify the beauty you know.”How does your music help people to forget about problems? “My music brings life to people. I want to celebrate people and bring them together. I also know that music can motivate people, that’s why sometimes I just dive into this humanitarian job as a musician.”FaithVonic produced a song together with other musicians in 2014 during the Ebola outbreak, to “help people feel alive again”. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, her song is meant to raise awareness and invite people to take the virus seriously.And for you, how does music help you? “For me, music is an escape from trauma. Music calms me a lot. It\\'s like my peace of mind.“Growing up with my stepfather wasn\\'t the perfect childhood. He was violent, especially after he had a drink. My mom and I as females didn’t have a voice in the house. It was almost like he was our boss. And you don\\'t say anything when your boss is wrong, even when what you think is right. It was scary and at a certain point, I hated men.”How did your view on men change? “I\\'ve been in so many different crises related to men and it makes me stronger really. I know now that not every man is like that.“A man will never put me in a position where I’m silent anymore. I know my worth, I know who I am and I know what I\\'m capable of, and besides that, we\\'re not in a century anymore where women remain silent. In Africa, women are supposed to submit to their men once they’re married, but you need to remember that you have a voice. Women need to know their rights.”How do you make sure Liberian women know their rights? “I use my platform and tell women that I’ve been in their position as well. I go live and talk to my fans. We talk about women, gender violence and how it affects them. They need to know that their situation is not okay and that they can get out. I have never had someone tell me that I could get out. It was just me and God.“When I partnered up with ActionAid Liberia (a global NGO, focusing on development and human rights) we went to the Red Light Market, a very big market in Liberia. We talked to men and had a very simple message for them; they should appreciate the things that their wives do at home. Some men in Liberia think that the fact that you\\'re a woman, makes it your responsibility to do the chores in the house. It shouldn\\'t be that because you\\'re women you\\'re forced to clean and do laundry. Men can do it too.”How did the men respond? “Some men were rude when I talked to them. They said that we are changing the mentality of women. I wanted to make them understand that the message is so simple, you guys just have to appreciate the things your wives do. “Do you see these traditional gender roles also with younger generations in Liberia? “My problem is actually with the younger generation of women. They are not participating in things that men do. In other parts of the world, I see female electricians and mechanics, but you won’t find girls doing that in Liberia.“I performed once in front of a lot of young girls, most of them were around 17/18. I asked them who wants to be a nurse and almost everybody put their hands up. I said okay that\\'s good, but who wants to be a mechanic? Not even a single girl raised her hand. I was astonished, including the ambassador of the event. She was like huh? you guys don\\'t think you can do it? One of the girls said to me it’s a man’s job, it’s not for women. From that moment I knew that this is one of the problems that is affecting them. This is why women don\\'t really get jobs here. You can’t all work in the same field.”How do you think this can change? “People need to educate them that some jobs are not only for men, a woman can do it too. They don\\'t have people encouraging them to do a ‘man’s job’.If I wasn\\'t a musician, I would be a builder. When I see people building a house, I want to learn it, but every time I ask them they have so many things to tell me. The bricks are heavy, it will hurt your hands, just so many excuses, they are not even encouraging me to try.”Why do you have the mindset to be interested in doing a ‘man’s job’? “I\\'m the kind of person who wants to learn a lot, I don’t care if it is a man\\'s job and I think there are other girls like me. My mum taught me to be independent, be a strong woman and know how to take care of myself. My father was not around so my mum was a woman and a man at the same time. She said I shouldn’t depend on men entirely in my life. 80 per cent depends on you as an individual.”Curious about FaithVonic’s music? You can find her songs here.

Several studies have suggested that when it comes to being environmentally conscious, there is a green gender gap.Men are less likely to live sustainably than women, a phenomenon researchers from the latest study call the ‘green-feminine stereotype’.The link between gender and sustainability is not new, over recent years there have been several reports showing how men litter more, recycle less and leave a bigger carbon footprint than women.Women are also more clued up on climate change - they are more likely to support environmental regulations and know more about the science behind melting ice caps and rising seas. And, perhaps rather unsurprisingly given the knowledge they are armed with, they are also far more likely to express concern about the impact it will have on us and future generations.But the most recent research paper by professors from five universities in the US found another reason why more women than men lean towards being green - saving the planet is simply \\'a bit girly\\'.The paper entitled ‘Is Eco-Friendly Unmanly? The Green-Feminine Stereotype and Its Effect on Sustainable Consumption’ and published in the Journal of Consumer Research, set out to explain this gender gap. It found a psychological link between eco-friendliness and perceptions of femininity.Being eco-friendly, the study’s authors claim, is cognitively linked to being more feminine - by both men and women.In a series of experiments involving 2,000 participants from the US and China, scientists found “both men and women both judged eco-friendly products, behaviours, and consumers as more feminine than their non-green counterparts”.In one experiment, participants of both sexes described an individual who brought a tote bag to the supermarket as more feminine than someone who used a plastic bag - regardless of whether the shopper was a male or female.In another, participants perceived themselves to be more feminine after recalling a time when they did something good versus bad for the environment. And when men were given a pink floral gift card to buy items including lamps, backpacks and batteries, they opted for the least green version of each product as a way to assert their masculinity in the face of the double feminine associations of the pink gift card and eco-friendliness.The researchers claim the problem lies, not with guys, but marketeers who are not doing enough to make their products enticing to men. They suggest the key to encouraging men to make environmentally-friendly choices is to make green products more masculine - or as they put it ‘men-vironmentally-friendly’ using fonts, colours and words that would appeal to gender constructs of masculinity.“Make the man feel manly,” the researchers said, “and he’s more likely to go green.” But, is this really the answer? Surely the biggest issue of our lifetime - and beyond - should be a gender-neutral one.Fashion designer, activist and author of Fashion Animals - and a vegan - Joshua Katcher, started his own sustainable menswear lined, Brave GentleMan in 2008. Brooklyn-based Katcher says he has experienced many raised eyebrows, and worse, at his lifestyle choices over the years.“I do see mainstream masculinity as a roadblock to sustainability as a cultural crisis right now,” he says. “I’ve experienced it. I’ve had to answer for it and I’ve also had to modify my life in order to prove a point.“I feel that caring about people, caring about animals, caring about nature, those are often relegated to the realm of the feminine,” Katcher explains.A post shared by Brave GentleMan (@brave_gentleman) on Mar 21, 2019 at 4:06pm PDTHe says things have changed a lot over the last 10 years or so, but there is still plenty to do and believes the key lies - at least in the short term - in spinning sustainability to men threatened by perceived ideas of femininity and environmental issues in a way that makes them the hero in this ultimate apocalypse story.Katcher explains, “I think we have to come up with clever ways to make sustainability rewarding and appealing to mainstream men without compromising so much that it becomes harder for the people who are already being harmed by that archetype.“What I’ve tried to do with the Discerning Brute (Katcher’s blog) is tap into our ideas of heroic power, of protective power. I think that there’s a way to appeal to those types of men where they want that feeling of being physically capable of doing something significant in order to provide, in order to protect.”“I think if we can focus on those positives, like the hero, the protector, the defender, that there’s a way to approach sustainability and ethics through those archetypes in a way that doesn’t threaten. That says, ‘yes, you are strong, you are powerful, and here you can help’. Here’s the hero that we need.Katcher thinks this needs only be a temporary solution to appease older men who “aren’t going to change their habits or worldviews” but believes younger generations are being brought up by parents who expose them to these concerns and are less threatened by perceived attacks on mainstream masculinity.One man who has not felt the burden of societal pressure when it comes to green issues is Nuno Goncalves, Executive Chef at Quaglino\\'s in London.In this most male of environment’s Goncalves is leading this bastain of Mayfair society towards a more sustainable future, seeing it as his responsibility to create awareness and help customers dine more consciously, revamping the menu to include mainly local sustainable and ethically sourced produce.Goncalves said he has “always been environmentally conscious” and has not felt his gender has inhibited his environmental commitments and credentials.“To be honest I have never considered a gender gap when it comes to sustainability, I feel sustainability should have nothing to do with your gender, but rather it should be the responsibility of everyone to source local sustainable ingredients in order to combat the current environmental issues the world is facing,” he said.Any resistance Goncalves has felt has not been directed at his masculinity but a general lack of awareness. “I feel it is our responsibility as food industry professionals to educate our guests in that sense. I have not felt at any point my gender has had a negative influence,” he explains.Super heroes don’t always wear capes - but they do always care (and recycle).Every weekday at 15.30 CET, Euronews Living brings you a cutting edge, environmental story from somewhere around the world.

I think that there’s a way to appeal to those types of men where they want that feeling of being physically capable of doing something significant in order to provide, in order to protect.”“I think if we can focus on those positives, like the hero, the protector, the defender, that there’s a way to approach sustainability and ethics through those archetypes in a way that doesn’t threaten. That says, ‘yes, you are strong, you are powerful, and here you can help’. Here’s the hero that we need.Katcher thinks this needs only be a temporary solution to appease older men who “aren’t going to change their habits or worldviews” but believes younger generations are being brought up by parents who expose them to these concerns and are less threatened by perceived attacks on mainstream masculinity.One man who has not felt the burden of societal pressure when it comes to green issues is Nuno Goncalves, Executive Chef at Quaglino\\'s in London.In this most male of environment’s Goncalves is leading this bastain of Mayfair society towards a more sustainable future, seeing it as his responsibility to create awareness and help customers dine more consciously, revamping the menu to include mainly local sustainable and ethically sourced produce.Goncalves said he has “always been environmentally conscious” and has not felt his gender has inhibited his environmental commitments and credentials.“To be honest I have never considered a gender gap when it comes to sustainability, I feel sustainability should have nothing to do with your gender, but rather it should be the responsibility of everyone to source local sustainable ingredients in order to combat the current environmental issues the world is facing,” he said.Any resistance Goncalves has felt has not been directed at his masculinity but a general lack of awareness. “I feel it is our responsibility as food industry professionals to educate our guests in that sense. I have not felt at any point my gender has had a negative influence,” he explains.Super heroes don’t always wear capes - but they do always care (and recycle).Every weekday at 15.30 CET, Euronews Living brings you a cutting edge, environmental story from somewhere around the world.

You had the courage to mobilise the women of Liberia to take back their country”, said Sirleaf in part of her acceptance speech dedicated to her fellow countrywoman Leymah Gbowee. “You redefined the frontline of a brutal civil conflict – women dressed in white, demonstrating in the streets – a barrier no warlord was brave enough to cross.”Award-winning director Gini Reticker travelled to Monrovia to tell the story of these women and she did so in the 2008 documentary Pray the Devil Back to Hell.

All victims of violence and hunger.Now If you haven’t heard the documentary episodes of our Liberian series, we invite you to do so by visiting our website.Hi Gini, hi Cecillia, thank you so much for joining us here on the Cry Like a Boy podcast. We will get back to you in a minute.Gini Reticker, whose career is distinguished by placing women at the center of her stories, released the 2008 documentary Pray the Devil Back to Hell, which recounts the struggle of this group of Liberian women to demand an end to the armed struggle from the men.In addition to listening to this conversation now, do you think women can be peace enablers? Can their voices be heard in men dominated societies? How do they fight to make a change? Let\\'s discover it now in this episode.Let\\'s start with you, Gini. How did you discover this story and why did you decide it was worth traveling to Liberia and making a documentary?Gini Reticker: First, thanks so much for having us both here today. And it\\'s interesting, I actually heard about the story of women in Liberia by a very chance encounter with the producer, Abby Disney. She had just gotten back from Liberia in a celebration of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\\'s inauguration as president and came back and we ran into each other and she was saying, while I was there, I heard something really interesting had happened in Liberia with women. And, you know, I was following the story in Liberia — I thought. All that I had heard about what was happening with women was just horrible stories of rape and violence. And I was like, I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. And there was no reporting of it at all in the mainstream media in the United States. And then Leymah Gbowee came to speak at the United Nations. And Abby and I went and met with Leymah in the hotel lobby where she was staying. She recounted her story, the story of all of the women in Liberia. And I was completely blown away and said, wow, if this is really true, this is a film. And I think within a few weeks we were on a plane to Liberia.Mame Peya Diaw: Thank you Gini for your answer. Back then, thousands of women, ordinary mothers, grandmothers, aunts and daughters, both Christian and Muslim, came together to pray for peace and then staged a silent protest outside the presidential palace, putting pressure on Liberian men to pursue peace or lose physical intimacy with their wives. Among them was Cecelia Danuweli. How did you become part of this movement and when did you decide that women had to intervene to stop the war?Cecelia Danuweli: Cecelia Danuweli: Well, I thank you for having me on this podcast. I decided to join this group in 2002 when the war began to rage in the capital, Monrovia, because I was a displaced woman coming from Boone County, from Bangor. And then when I came and saw how women were treated and others were treated, the men, the younger children, the way they were and we\\'re dying of hunger. And I was like, we need to stop this thing. We need to stop this war. And then I came in contact with Leymah (Gbowee) and Leymah started to recruit us and she brought us onboard. 2002 first and then 2003. We started the whole process where we had our first meeting and then she called me and I was among those 20 women that joined the whole process. And we started with the advocacy, coming from embassy to embassy, coming to the marketplace. And from there we started this mass action for peace under the banner of WIPNET (Women in Peacebuilding Network).Mame Peya Diaw: I see and it\\'s interesting to see how you managed to succeed with this mass action because Liberia at that time had extremely limited civil rights, but still thousands of women from various classes mobilized their efforts and staged these nonviolent protests. So, Cecelia, how did you organise yourselves to bring so many different women together? What did you say to the men so that they would listen to you?Cecelia Danuweli: We started at our homes, we started to feel almost like disciplining our husbands, that we were not going to have sex. We\\'re not going to do anything because we\\'re not happy. And because of that, they were like, ‘oh, I got to pay attention to you, guys’. And so we started going from marketplaces, from schools. We went to the schools we tried to bring on board after we started the whole process of explaining to the public, especially when they saw we started the market fully. We went to one of these schools and it was kind of my move. And at that time we saw the elderly. They were dying of hunger. We saw the women, some of them were being raped and were extremely distressed. And we saw the children, some of them, were dying. And I was like, what? This thing I feel we need to put an end to this. So it means that we all need to come together as women to go after this. And so we started going from the marketplace, we went to the schools, went to the mosques, we went to the churches, all up to making sure that we put an end to this carnage because we heard that we went to the concert and the rebels were supposed to go from street to street, from house to house. And we\\'re like, we can stay in your house and allow this to go on. So we need to have a safe space. And it was the fish market where we congregate every morning. If it rained, we repeated, sunshiny, we are there. And so we took it from all fronts, from our homes to the community, from the community. And then we went to the larger society where we communicate. And if you and thousands of people were going to their funeral homes or going to their houses, going to work. They will see us doing it. And so we started joining and joining the people who are just coming. We had the space and the place was so crowded. They started to join us. The Muslim women started to join when the Christian women started to join and all of that. And that\\'s how we mobilized the entire country because we came from different countries and cultures. If you come from your county, you make sure that your county gets involved with the entire country. So all of the counties were a part of this whole mess.Mame Peya Diaw: And this must have been quite a challenge, considering that at that time, Liberian men would not see the damaging threat that their actions or behaviors would put on the whole community. I\\'ll come back to you later Cecilia. Gini, what was your first encounter with these women like? What struck you the most the first time you met them?Gini Reticker: The first time I met these women, I think, was in December of 2005. So the war had been over for a couple of years. And Leymah brought about 20 women together for me to meet, for them to tell their stories. And I think it was probably one of the biggest impressions on me in my life because there were 20 women gathered at that point. There was still very little electricity in Liberia because it had been knocked out during the war and women sat around in a circle and told the stories of what they had been through. And, you know, it was a 14 year war. So people had very different stories over a long period of time, though, people basically everybody talked about some of the same things. But I remember just being completely blown away by the determination and strength of the women and by the commitment. And I remember asking. How did you keep going? How did you do this? How did you keep going and what would happen when you would get down? And somebody started to say we would sing and somebody started to sing, and then the women all started to hum and sing together and the sun was going down. We were losing light. We couldn\\'t keep filming. And I remember walking away feeling like. I was charged with the profound responsibility to try to get the story right.Mame Peya Diaw: Absolutely because of their determination and strength like you just mentioned Cecilia, today these women are recognised for their braviour. And according to Leymah Gbowee, responsible for leading this nonviolent peace movement, women felt like Liberian men were really not taking a stand for them. They considered these men like fighters or they were very silent to them, accepting all of the violence that was being thrown at them as a nation. So here\\'s a question for the both of you. Why do you think it was the women of Liberia and not the men who organised to demand peace?Cecelia Danuweli: Because the men, they could not come outside to do anything. If they came outside to say something or to do anything they were constricted. The young boys were constricted and taken to the front to fight. Whether you agree or not, the men were also taking the child soldiers with them. And we couldn\\'t just stay there and allow our sons and our husbands to go to the frontline. And so the women decided that they were the mothers to go. And in Liberia, if a woman decides to do something, especially coming up in that particular area or going to that party, perform that particular fact, they are effective because they know that if women are braver, we are committed to the process. And so we went, oh, we couldn\\'t allow our children because they would be killed. Our husband will be killed if they come up. That\\'s what I thought it meant for all our boys. We were out there doing all other things for them at that time so they couldn\\'t get outside.Mame Peya Diaw: Same question for you, Gini, why do you think it was the women of Liberia and not the men who organised the demand for peace?Gini Reticker: I actually don\\'t think I have anything to add to this. I mean, I agree with what she said that the men would have been in danger. I remember Leymah telling me that, like, they didn\\'t invite the men to come on to the field with them where they were protesting every day, because if their men were there, the women would get attacked. They were much safer, braver it was. And they were from both religions, both factions. They were able to bring things together and to put a moral shame on people too.Mame Peya: Thank you to the both of you, Gini and Cecelia, for your thoughts on this very important subject.

I only came to know of my HIV status in 2017,” a decade later, Lehloebi said in an interview.In 2019, he began actively participating in advocacy programmes that encourage other men to get tested.His activism comes as the Lesotho government and its development partners are also focusing efforts on tackling the reasons why men are less likely than women to get tested for HIV.The teenager uses every chance he gets to encourage his peers and older men to get tested and immediately start taking antiretrovirals if they test positive.“There are men who are currently locking themselves up in their houses, refusing to seek medical attention despite presenting with signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases,\" he said.He blames this on the way local men are brought up, not to show emotions or ask for help.“As a young man living with HIV, I know just how hard it can be for any man raised to demonstrate his manhood by bottling things up,\" he said.He admitted that this has caused him to take risks with his health.\"I myself have defaulted on my medication a couple of times because I didn’t want people thinking I am weak by sharing my fears around living with the virus.\"Set in a scenic landscape of hills and narrow valleys, the village of Maphutseng became Lehloebi’s home shortly after his third birthday.This was after his mother died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2005, leaving relatives with no option but to send Lehloebi to stay with his grandmother.“My mother was HIV positive but never enrolled for antiretrovirals because of the stigma,\" he said.\"Instead of taking her to a medical doctor for her to enroll in HIV treatment, her sisters took her from traditional healers to religious leaders.\"His mother was HIV positive at the time she gave birth to him in 2002. She infected him and died three years later.He is one of 73,000 HIV orphans -- children who have lost at least one parent to HIV-related illness -- in Lesotho, which has the second highest prevalence of the virus in the world.Soon after moving to the village, Lehloebi started falling ill. He regularly spent time in hospital without receiving a clear diagnosis and was bedridden.Then “one day my sister took me to (the capital) Maseru and I got tested for HIV. I tested positive on 6 March 2007 and I was not able to immediately go to school until the following year, 2008,” he said.Yet his family decided against telling him the real reason why he had to take antiretroviral medicine every day.He recalled that one day he was sent to collect the medicine himself.“I asked my grandmother what that medication was for and like a conventional adult she was, she said the medication was for my constant nose bleeding episodes, \" he said.\"From that day, I only started taking the medication when my nose bled and I would throw the remaining tablets in a river because I didn’t want my grandmother to know.”He suspects his grandmother later shared the secret of his HIV status with someone in the village because people started gossiping about it when he was in sixth grade at school.“I was discriminated (against) . My fellow learners did not want to talk or walk with me. Children would not wash their hands after me at the school tap, \" he remembered.“I became a loner and that was the most painful year of my life. I lost interest in my school work. I didn’t understand what was going on because my grandmother insisted the medication was for nose bleeding and the outside world said I was HIV positive.”After he successfully passed his primary school leaving certificate in 2014, Lehloebi\\'s sister arranged for him to move to Lesotho’s capital of Maseru. This meant he transferred from the village clinic to Baylor College of Medicine Children’s Foundation, a centre formed in 2005 to help children living with HIV.The foundation offers universal access to care, treatment, and support for all HIV-infected and -affected children and their families throughout Lesotho and organises weekly meetings for the children.“I still didn’t understand why I was attending the meetings and I asked one of the attendees why he was there. He told me he was HIV positive and that is how and when I discovered I was HIV positive,\" Lehloebi said.At that time, he was attending high school and didn’t want to face the same stigma as at primary school.“I didn’t want people knowing or seeing me attending these meetings. I suffered a serious drama but Baylor patiently guided me into self-discovering and accepting my status,\" he said, while his sister offered \"unwavering support”.While Lehloebi did not want to reveal his HIV status, he had a nagging feeling that he wanted to help others in a similar situation to him.Eventually he teamed up with his friends to start a support group for boys and men who are struggling to come to terms with their HIV status or even to get tested.They first sought guidance and counseling from their supervisor at Baylor, who warned them “of the challenges that come with publicly disclosing our statuses and becoming activists\", he said.\"In 2020, we publicly announced our HIV statuses and I am using social media platforms to challenge many misconceptions surrounding HIV.\"It is still mostly women who approach him for help, he said.\"Very few men do.\"He insists nevertheless that \"a strong man stands up and asks for help,\" rather than choosing to \"hide behind closed doors and die alone”. And he is optimistic about changing men’s attitudes.“One man at a time, we will eventually have more men opening up,” he insisted.He also wants to change how men view their sexual relationships.One of the problems causing the spread of HIV is that \"the majority of men want to prove their manhood by having multiple partners and I think that is a sign of weakness, \" Lehloebi said.Again, he puts this down to ideas about masculinity absorbed from childhood.\"We need to help them rediscover the true meaning of manhood because the manner in which we are raised, messes us up as men.\"Despite its small population of 2 million, Lesotho has the second-highest HIV prevalence in the world after Eswatini.According to a recent study by the Lesotho Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (LePHIA), the total adult population living with HIV is 306,000 and 20.8 percent of them are males.Data from LePHIA also demonstrates that men in Lesotho are less likely to get tested for HIV.According to estimates by LePHIA, 71% of males reported knowing their HIV status compared to 81.5% of females. Men are therefore less likely to get access to appropriate care and treatment services.To close this gap, the Lesotho government and its development partners have introduced men’s clinics at some busy health facilities to scale up HIV treatment access for men, run by the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation (EGPAF), a US-based nonprofit.Men need separate clinics because they tend to “perceive clinics as more women- and child-friendly, they have a concern about services provided by female health workers,\" the foundation says on its website.Another factor is that men\\'s \"schedules don’t align with the long wait times at clinics and with the services only being provided during hours when they are at work”.Seabata Makoae, a social worker for She-Hive, an association of survivors of gender-based violence and those affected by it, said in an interview that many men in Lesotho do not want to take HIV tests because doing so is seen as a sign of weakness.“A lot of men do not want to be seen going to the clinics to be tested for HIV because they hold the deeply rooted, unhealthy thoughts that doing so would make them be seen as weak men,\" he said.The gender activist said that popular ideas that men should suppress their feelings or emotions at all costs affect their decisions, even on serious issues such as seeking health services.Even when men spot signs that they may have sexually transmitted diseases, \"they will not go to the clinics because of stigma,\" he said.Some even believe \"it is shameful for them to undress before a young female nurse.\"Men rely instead on their female partners getting tested for HIV, either voluntarily or when pregnant, and \"use their partners’ HIV test results as their own results,\" Makoae added. They assume wrongly that a partner\\'s negative test indicates their own status.Makoae says fear of being seen as weak also means some men stop taking medication they are prescribed to control HIV infection.“All of this boils down to the manner in which men were raised, to withstand pain against all odds.\"To help release this emotional suppression, She-Hive has a special programme targeting men only and has created a safe space for men to open up.“This is where we talk to them in their own safe space -- men to men -- and they are more open because they don’t fear being judged or laughed at by the women. They know and trust the process: that this is men sharing amongst themselves,” Makoae said.He also suggests that families also need to change and raise boys with less toxic attitudes, stressing that this is a deep-rooted problem in Lesotho.“There is this thing that we grow up with as Basotho men, that a male is not allowed to cry or express pain in any way, \" he said, referring to the country’s main ethnic group.“We grew up in an environment where boys are treated differently from girls, boys are taught to toughen up while girls are told it is OK to cry and express your feelings.\"Activism by young men like Lehloebi goes a long way in breaking down barriers preventing men from seeking help, he said.“Having people like (Lehloebi) openly talking about their HIV statuses would encourage others to go for HIV testing and open up about their status,\" he said.\"In that way, we are encouraging other men to adhere to medication as well as showing them that asking for help does not make one a weak man.\"_This story was edited by Anna Malpas. _This programme was funded by the European Journalism Centre, through the European Development Journalism Grants programme.

The Federation has said that according to its own calculations, in a do-nothing scenario the gap will not be closed for another 80 years.\"The lower wages, part-time work and unpaid work lead to today\\'s scandalously poor pension situation for women - with no end in sight,\" it said.  The proposed amendments to the pension scheme, known as AHV 21, aim in sum to safeguard its financial future until 2030. Raising the retirement age for women by one year alone would save around 10 billion francs (€9.1 billion) between 2022 and 2031.Proponents of the reform in the Swiss parliament\\'s centre-right majority also point out that women live longer on average than men, so most benefit more from the AHV in the course of their lives.But critics point out that because of the pay gap, the average pension for women who retired in 2019 was 1,160 francs (€1,047) per month while for men, it stood at 2,144 francs (€1,936).  Former Green Party MP Katharina Prelicz-Huber, president of the Swiss Union of Public Service Personnel, said: “A childcare specialist earns 4,000-4200 francs a month when starting in a career and, after 10 years of experience, 4,500-4,700 francs per month. \"The only reason for the low wages is that the work is done by women.

This wave of interest is inspired, in some ways, by a critical agenda of revealing the dynamics of gender, including conversations on formerly unexamined experiences of men in public discourse, scholarship, activism and generally in everyday life. In particular, increasing focus on men, as subjects of gender conversations could spark a possible change.That change involves unpacking historical forms of patriarchal power and privilege, interrogating the social process through which masculine and feminine behaviours and practices are framed, policed and reproduced, the effect gender identities have.This wave of thought motivated my reflection on the common yet taken-for-granted social learnings and expectations about men in Uganda. Social sanctions such as “Onaba Musajja nabakyi ggwe?” what sort of a man will you be?, common to most Ugandan communities, are the subject of this reflection.In early 2008, I lost my sister after a short illness. She was in her prime years, newly graduated and working at one of the universities in the country. Her passing happened in the same season my dad had retired from public service after 40 years of work.These hard times occurred when I had just enrolled for graduate studies at Makerere University, with my sister as one of my volunteer sponsors. Her passing and the circumstances at the time could be described as unbearable. However, it was my dad’s reaction to these challenging times that left me with an avid urge to know who my dad ‘really’ was.I had keenly observed, albeit unintentionally, that unlike most of us who broke down emotionally, my dad did not cry throughout the grieving period nor at the final send-off of my sister. When I returned home from the university a month after the burial, I found my dad perusing through a photo album of my sister. I never had a conversation with him about what he was going through at the time.Besides, our conversations with him were very limited and often predictable. They rotated around requests for school fees or when he was required to go for parents’ meetings at school. We hardly talked, laughed, and joked as we did with the rest of the family members.Looking back at these subtle everyday experiences – the relationship with our dad and his emotional expressions or the suppression of these during the bereavement – alerts us to possible ways through which men’s behaviours and practices are guided by sets of expectations.Why didn’t my dad cry over the passing of his young daughter? Or perhaps he did, but how and where? What constrains men’s public expression of emotions of this nature? What implications do such suppressions of masculine emotions have on men and other people around them? These and perhaps many more questions could be part of the contemporary concerns of our time.It is astounding how such kinds of constrained men’s expression of emotions are widespread across different cultures, although with contextual particularities.Quite often, there are moments in my community where male babies are restrained from crying, just because they are expected to bear the pain as the ideal of manliness. In our local Luganda dialect, it is not uncommon for a young crying boy to be teased and asked Onaba mussajja nabaki ggwe? (what sort of a man will you be?).In the east of the country, a common cultural practice of male circumcision is a rite of passage into adulthood. During this process, the boy facing the knife must stand strong and face the cheering crowds of men without blinking. Going against this tradition (e.g. opting for sedated hospital circumcision) has life-long implications of being discredited as a man.Experiences such as these alert us to ways in which men and women must publicly account for who they are. Often, men\\'s and women’s actions in everyday life are dictated by society\\'s expectations, i.e. how they might look and how they act.Negation, repression and the silencing of men’s expressions such as prohibited crying amongst young boys and in their adulthood, might reveal clues to the underlying and fundamental regulatory frameworks that guide acceptable forms of male and female behaviour.Yet, these actions constrained by gender are both serious and consequential.Policing men’s emotional expressions e.g. through instruction not to cry, to man-up, to face hardships like a man, among other stereotypes, have the effect of depriving men of cultural, social and linguistic emotional resources that have psychological and therapeutic benefits. In effect, characterising emotional virtues as unmanly deprives men of relational experiences and drives them towards depressive disorders.For instance, there are health studies, which indicate that gender socialisation experiences, which reinforce men’s anger and emotion suppression responses, can cause and contribute to depression. There are experiences where ‘hardened’ forms of male behaviour are linked to the risks of violent death, whether this violence is amongst male peers or which is perpetrated against women and girls.I must note that regardless of the pervasive character of patriarchy and the prevalence of gender socialisation, in which men\\'s and women’s conduct is policed by a vast array of social institutions, there is nothing about a gender system that is given.Men\\'s and women’s behavior and practices are a product of the societies they inhabit. As such, gender is an innovative affair. Although, it is quite clear that there are strict punishments for contesting the script by performing out of turn or through unwarranted improvisation.Understanding that gender is social and that its associated harmful behaviours and expectations can change is an optimistic aspect of any effort towards the transformation of unequal gender relations.Men and women can perform alternative ways of being beyond the normalised yet harmful behaviours and practices. Men can step outside the reach of power and upset the established laws. What is needed is to know the cost of performing masculinity differently in progressive ways and the kinds of social, cultural and linguistic resources we need to do so.Dr Amon Ashaba Mwiine is a Lecturer at the School of Women and Gender Studies, Makerere University.

Or perhaps he did, but how and where? What constrains men’s public expression of emotions of this nature? What implications do such suppressions of masculine emotions have on men and other people around them? These and perhaps many more questions could be part of the contemporary concerns of our time.It is astounding how such kinds of constrained men’s expression of emotions are widespread across different cultures, although with contextual particularities.Quite often, there are moments in my community where male babies are restrained from crying, just because they are expected to bear the pain as the ideal of manliness. In our local Luganda dialect, it is not uncommon for a young crying boy to be teased and asked Onaba mussajja nabaki ggwe? (what sort of a man will you be?).In the east of the country, a common cultural practice of male circumcision is a rite of passage into adulthood. During this process, the boy facing the knife must stand strong and face the cheering crowds of men without blinking. Going against this tradition (e.g. opting for sedated hospital circumcision) has life-long implications of being discredited as a man.Experiences such as these alert us to ways in which men and women must publicly account for who they are. Often, men\\'s and women’s actions in everyday life are dictated by society\\'s expectations, i.e. how they might look and how they act.Negation, repression and the silencing of men’s expressions such as prohibited crying amongst young boys and in their adulthood, might reveal clues to the underlying and fundamental regulatory frameworks that guide acceptable forms of male and female behaviour.Yet, these actions constrained by gender are both serious and consequential.Policing men’s emotional expressions e.g. through instruction not to cry, to man-up, to face hardships like a man, among other stereotypes, have the effect of depriving men of cultural, social and linguistic emotional resources that have psychological and therapeutic benefits. In effect, characterising emotional virtues as unmanly deprives men of relational experiences and drives them towards depressive disorders.For instance, there are health studies, which indicate that gender socialisation experiences, which reinforce men’s anger and emotion suppression responses, can cause and contribute to depression. There are experiences where ‘hardened’ forms of male behaviour are linked to the risks of violent death, whether this violence is amongst male peers or which is perpetrated against women and girls.I must note that regardless of the pervasive character of patriarchy and the prevalence of gender socialisation, in which men\\'s and women’s conduct is policed by a vast array of social institutions, there is nothing about a gender system that is given.Men\\'s and women’s behavior and practices are a product of the societies they inhabit. As such, gender is an innovative affair. Although, it is quite clear that there are strict punishments for contesting the script by performing out of turn or through unwarranted improvisation.Understanding that gender is social and that its associated harmful behaviours and expectations can change is an optimistic aspect of any effort towards the transformation of unequal gender relations.Men and women can perform alternative ways of being beyond the normalised yet harmful behaviours and practices. Men can step outside the reach of power and upset the established laws. What is needed is to know the cost of performing masculinity differently in progressive ways and the kinds of social, cultural and linguistic resources we need to do so.Dr Amon Ashaba Mwiine is a Lecturer at the School of Women and Gender Studies, Makerere University.

Doctors who carry out abortions face up to 3 years in prison.As a result, many Polish women are forced to continue pregnancies against their will, while others go abroad to have abortions. Others have abortions in secret at home.The law sparked the country\\'s biggest protests in its post-communist era and drew international condemnation, including from the European Union.Abortion without Borders, an initiative founded in 2019 to support women in unintended pregnancies in Poland and abroad, says it has helped a total of 17,000 people access abortion, either at home - using pills - or abroad, in clinics, in the first six months after the Polish constitutional court ruling.That is a significant increase compared to 2019 when 5,000 women turned to the group for help in terminating their pregnancies.Kasia, 15, was one of those the charity helped. She was 12 weeks pregnant when she managed to tell her mother that she was expecting. She was worried about disappointing her mother but instead she contacted Abortion Without Borders on her daughter\\'s behalf.Kasia had an abortion in the Netherlands last month.Women Help Women, a group providing postal access to abortion pills, says it has responded to over 46,000 messages from Poland and provided help to 10,000 people.\"It\\'s been devastating for women because it is clearly an oppressive system that has developed against their health and their lives,\" said Irene Donadio, senior lead of strategy and partnership at the International Planned Parenthood Federation-European Network (IPPF-EN).But she also noted the \"amazing resistance and resilience among women in Poland with activists that have been engaged immediately in mobilising solidarity and raising funds to support women in situations of hardship.\"The Abortion Abroad initiative said it raised over €91,000 of funds in the six months after the ruling.The funds were used, among other things, to cover the costs of abortion procedures and pills, pay for accommodation and travel as well as COVID tests.Another example of cross-border solidarity is the group Ciocia Czesia (Auntie Czech), which was set up last year to help Polish women seek abortion in the neighbouring Czech Republic.\"We felt the need to do something,\" Marta Machalowska from Ciocia Czesia told Euronews.The group got in contact with similar collectives in Berlin and Vienna - Ciocia Basia and Ciocia Wienia - while launching a fundraising campaign to help cover the costs of the procedures, travel and accommodation.Machalowska told Euronews that about 215 women contacted Ciocia Czesia thus far. The group provides them with legal and practical information in their language and puts them in touch with Polish-speaking medical staff.In some cases, the group covers the costs of the procedure and travel completely, and in others only partially.\"Many private businesses would like to have a piece of this cake,\" Machalowska noted, adding that a group was \"against abortion tourism.\"Accusations of abortion tourism were at the centre of an angry letter sent to the Czech government by a Polish diplomat in Prague, according to media reports.The diplomat was quoted as writing: \"From the point of view of Czech-Polish relations, we perceive it as unfortunate if legislative proposals to legalise commercial abortion tourism are openly justified by the intention to circumvent Polish legislation protecting unborn human life, and if those proposals have the purpose of encouraging Polish citizens to break Polish law.\"The letter came as the Czech parliament debated new legislation that would clarify the terms under which foreigners can get abortions in the country.Euronews reached out to the Polish Foreign Ministry to confirm and comment on the letter but had received no response at the time of publication.According to Czech media, the Czech government replied that Poland did not have the ability to interfere with internal legislative processes and that abortions on Polish women on its territory was in line with both domestic and EU law.Machalowska explained that abortion was completely legal in the Czech Republic for up to 12 weeks of pregnancy for any person legally staying in the country, including EU citizens. In case of pathological reasons, the delay is extended to 24 weeks of pregnancy.The only change in the bill intends to ensure that Czech doctors are fully legally covered when they perform abortions, she told Euronews.In a statement published on Facebook in reaction to the Polish letter, the group said: “The visions and pleas of Polish politicians whose imaginations have been overwhelmed by values proclaimed from church pulpits will not have any impact here.”Polish women seeking to terminate their pregnancies also go to neighbouring Germany, Slovakia, or further in Europe, to the Netherlands and the UK.Yet coronavirus restrictions create additional obstacles for Polish women seeking abortion abroad.\"Covid is the biggest challenge,\" Machalowska said, with travel rules and restrictions \"changing almost every week.\"COVID testing and visa requirements also mean much higher costs for support groups working on already thin resources.Due to social distancing rules, Ciocia Czesia activists have not been able to accompany the women to the hospital and their support was provided exclusively online, Machalowska told Euronews.Meanwhile, women\\'s rights defenders in Poland face threats and repression.\"There is this atmosphere of terror that state agents are trying to impose on anyone who doesn\\'t want to obey the fundamentalist agenda,\" Donadio told Euronews, pointing to a report released last month by IPPF-EN, Human Rights Watch and CIVICUS.\"And we see that human rights activists are deprived of their freedom to protest, their freedom of assembly.

They wanted to come at night to pick up girls to rape them,” says Fatoumata, 21, describing her journey from Conakry, Guinea, to Algeria where she was planning to take a boat to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.She is one of few women from West Africa to brave these irregular migration routes.The routes are dangerous for migrants, but especially women, who can face sexual exploitation and rape on the journey.While crossing the Sahara desert with people smugglers from local Tuareg nomadic tribes, Fatoumata got lucky. She was protected by a man who walked alongside her.“Thank God, we were with a Malian whose wife was already in Algeria. When the Tuaregs came to ask for news, the guy said that I was his wife,” she said.“The Tuaregs knew they couldn\\'t have what they wanted, so they let us go”.But as she reached Algeria, all her money to make the final crossing through the Mediterranean was stolen. She then had to return home.In Guinea, she met with a similar kind of stigma that follows men. While men are seen as weak, women are seen as “bandits and prostitutes”, says Fatoumata.

Stay with us as we travel across the African continent to meet men who are defying centuries-old gender stereotypes and redefining their roles as men.The podcast is available in French under the name “Dans la tête des Hommes”.Listen to us on Castbox, Spotify, Apple, or wherever you listen to podcasts, and don’t hesitate to rate us or to leave a comment.Danielle Olavario: Welcome to Cry Like a Boy, a podcast in which we travel to five African countries to tell extraordinary stories of ordinary men defying centuries-old stereotypes. I’m Danielle Olavario.In the previous episode, we told you the story of Mamadou Alpha, a young Guinean man who went on a dangerous migration journey called “tounkan”, or “the adventure” to find success in Europe.In Guinea, this “adventure” is a rite of passage for some young men, who see the hardships and experiences they have on this journey as essential to becoming “real men”. Those who survive and make it, are treated as heroes, and those who fail, are shamed by their communities.In Europe, the term “adventure” is often associated with great explorers, pioneers, and travelers hiking up mountains and sailing the great wide ocean to seek fortune.Our story this week starts in the French Alps, where young men like Mamadou are crossing mountains. It is a different kind of adventure.It’s a quiet winter night and the snow is bright and crisp.We are at the Italian border near the city of Briançon. This region has recently become a crossroad for illegal migrants from the Balkans, Middle East or Africa, seeking a better life in Western Europe.The temperature has dropped below zero. The tall mountains seem dark and threatening, but Juliette, a 22-year-old photography student, knows these trails very well. Together with other locals, she’s looking for people who might have gotten lost or injured.Juliette:Some nights we get down with about 20 people, some nights no one.Danielle Olavario: Juliette is part of the association “Tous Migrants”. An initiative that helps find the people who have been on the road for many days, sometimes months. Many of them have frostbite, some are seriously injured, most are exhausted.In her backpack, there is always a first aid kit, hot beverages and candy bars.Juliette:These people are not necessarily equipped for the cold, they don’t always have hot drinks or food. We find people who are really cold. They haven\\'t eaten much and have nothing to drink.Danielle Olavario: “Tous Migrants” was founded in 2014 after the beginning of what politicians call the “European migrant crisis” when hundreds of thousands of people started arriving in Europe, gathering in huge migration camps in Greece or other parts of the continent.Many try to escape these conditions, hoping to cross into Western Europe on foot. And Briançon, France, a city nestled in the Alps, has become one of the hubs for those who were injured or lost their way during their “adventure”, and can’t quite continue the trip.Juliette:It\\'s not acceptable for us to let people die in the mountains, we don\\'t want our mountains to become cemeteries. It\\'s just not possible.Danielle Olavario: Since 2017 more than 12 000 people have gone through Refuge Solidaire, another NGO inBriançon, helping migrants with medical care, shelter and papers.But settling down isn’t that simple. We met with one of these migrant travelers in Gap, France, the largest city in the Hautes Alpes, a French region that borders Italy and famous for its sports culture and beautiful nature.Fana:My name is Syla Fana. I come from Guinea Conakry and I am 18-years-old.Danielle Olavario: Fana left at a young age because he thought he’d find better opportunities in Europe.Fana:Apart from the family situation, when you see the political, socio-economic situation of your country, even if you\\'re a kid, you can still have some thoughts. You think to yourself: why this? Why us?You see that there are all these resources, but you are struggling, you don\\'t live well, you live in misery.Danielle Olavario: He decided to go on “the adventure”, by travelling from Guinea to France.Fana:I left on my own at the age of 12. Can you imagine? It\\'s crazy. I went to Mali from Guinea.I met smugglers who actually take people from Mali to Algeria. In fact, I negotiated with them. I did all the necessary things with them. I left like that, country by country, country by country until I got to France.Danielle Olavario: Fana is from Conakry, Guinea. And like Mamadou, he went on the migration route to Europe. With one crucial difference: he made it to the other side and now lives in France.Fana:My family considers me a hero. The others? Maybe, who knows but I don\\'t know.There are many who are proud of you. There are also some who hate you because you have succeeded in your life.It’s calm here.I\\'ve been living here for a few months and I think, yeah.Danielle Olavario: Fana is wearing sunglasses, comfortable gray pants and a bright yellow hoodie. He seems confident and relaxed as we walk towards his apartment block. He’s been living in Gap for two years, but he has only recently moved to this residential area.Fana is in an “internat”, a kind of public boarding school where he is learning to be a caretaker for the elderly. Most of the time he sleeps at school, but during breaks, he lives with a friend.Their small studio is in slight disarray. A double bed takes most of the room and there are travel pictures of several people on the walls, but none are of Fana. You can tell that he doesn’t spend much time in the apartment.But he doesn’t mind. He hasn’t had a steady home for a really long time. The “adventure” wasn’t so easy for him. He says his family considers him a hero, except that he prefers to hide from them, for now.Fana:They haven\\'t heard from me for a long time and that\\'s normal. I would prefer it that way.I prefer to hide well. When I have a better life I\\'ll see my brothers, I\\'ll do what I can for the others. For now, I have to concentrate on what I am doing.Danielle Olavario: According to UNHCR, despite the coronavirus pandemic, over 41, 000 people arrived in Europe irregularly through Spain in 2020, undertaking the Mediterranean route. And Guineans were the second most numerous group of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa after Malians.Anthropologist Julie Kleinman, author of the book Adventure Capital about illegal migrants in Paris says, the desire to leave home in some West African cultures is a coming of age rite, and succeeding means you are a man.Julie Kleinman:In the 19th century there are many documented cases of leaving one\\'s village to become a man. In most of West Africa, leaving and migrating is a kind of initiation rite through which one becomes a man.Danielle Olavario: Fana says that already at the age of 12, boys in Guinea feel like grown-ups.Fana:He feels helpless if he sees his mother struggle. Trying to get something to eat when he knows that he is a boy, he is the one who has to help his parents.I know families in Africa, even in Guinea, where a 13-14-year-old child feeds the whole family. It\\'s from the age of 12 that he starts to work.Danielle Olavario: According to studies, poverty is generally one of the main drivers of migration from Guinea. The second is moving up the social ladder.Here’s Guinean sociologist Dr Abdoulaye Wotèm Somparé.Dr Abdoulaye Wotèm Somparé:The economic factor is there. But as it is not the poorest country, the most unstable country, the country where there is war, we must look for the answer elsewhere too.Do people not want to migrate because they want to get a promotion? A social promotion?After getting a job there, they send money, build houses. We have even noticed that in villages where there is a lot of immigration, such as the sub-prefecture of Kolaboui in Boké, the most beautiful houses belong to migrants living abroad, who are now positively called “Diaspo”.Danielle Olavario: Many migrants say that getting the papers is the most difficult part. But for most, the hardships on the road to success have to do with finding a place in their host country’s society.Here’s Julie Kleinman again.Julie Kleinman:The first and most serious way that the host country creates difficulties is through this economic marginalisation. That, of course, comes along with politics in terms of having or not having papers on immigration rights. So they both take away the rights of people by not allowing them to work legally. And even when they can work legally, they are very much sort of kept in a particular role of the unskilled, the quote-unquote unskilled migrant. And I do not agree with the word unskilled because most of these migrants will, in fact, gain a lot of skills while they\\'re abroad.Danielle Olavario: Fana finds that the adventure taught him a lot of things. And now that he’s settled, he can pursue his passion: taking care of others.Fana:I\\'m a bit versatile, I can do a lot of jobs, several jobs. But I like this school.Danielle Olavario: Julie Kleinman says that back home, working-class jobs like the one Fana is pursuing, are often not considered “manly” enough, but migrants don’t mind. Because they’re living the adventure. And someday, they will reach success.Julie Kleinman:There\\'s this famous saying in the Malian language “Tunga te danbe don”, meaning that exile has no dignity. So when you go abroad somewhere, you can do any kind of job. It\\'s not going to be an assault on your family\\'s lineage or on your own dignity, as it might be if you stayed in West Africa because you can do any sort of job.They use these resources to remind themselves that they can do these jobs, which may be considered less dignified where they\\'re from, but they can do them because they\\'re on this migratory adventure. And they use it as a resource to overcome some of the attacks on their dignity that they experience to remind themselves that this is not necessarily the context that counts the most.The context that counts the most is still where they\\'re from and their communities, where their lineage and their dignity as a man and as a person matter.Danielle Olavario: There is no African market in Gap. To get the food he’s used to, Fana has to go all the way to Marseille, a big port city in the Mediterranean. Often, he and his friends would take a car and load it with Guinean spices, vegetables, and peanut butter.When we ask Fana about Guinea, he lights up.Fana:I miss everything about Guinea. My family, the life there, even if it\\'s hard, but I like the life there, actually. It\\'s hard, but I was born there.The temperatures, the climate there. Even the air.Danielle Olavario: Despite homesickness, Fana doesn’t want to go back. As we’re walking towards the city centre after the interview, he says that the adventure was the best school of life he had.Fana:The adventure has really matured me and grown me, in fact. You have to know that great men are often not born great, they grow up. This is my case.Danielle Olavario: In the next episode of Cry Like a Boy, as always, my co-host Khopotso Bodibe, will meet two guests and explore the world of “the adventure” globally.Cry Like a Boy is published every second Thursday.

After the death of his father, all he ever wanted was to get his mother out of poverty and become the perfect son, the family hero. At just 18, he embarked on an illegal migration route to Europe Guineans call “the adventure”, or “tounkan” in the local Malinké language.Thousands of African adventurers or “tounkan namo” die on these routes trying to cross the Mediterranean in search of a better life in Italy, Germany or France.Mamadou didn’t die. Yet he considers his fate was worse than death. After months of exhaustion, hunger, and forced labour during the “tounkan”, he was forcefully returned home and faced anger from family and friends.In the next episode on April 29, we will explore what happens to the adventurers who succeed and end up in Europe.At home, they’re proudly called “diaspo” from the word “diaspora”. The diaspo are usually treated with the utmost respect, they also have the biggest houses in the neighbourhood. But is being the hero that easy? And at what cost do they earn this respect?Cry Like a Boy is an original Euronews series and podcast that explores how the pressure to be ‘a man’ can harm families and entire societies. Stay with us as we travel across the African continent to meet men who are defying centuries-old gender stereotypes, and redefining their roles as men.The podcast is available in French under the name “Dans la tête des hommes”.Listen to us on Castbox, Spotify, Apple or wherever you listen to podcasts and don’t hesitate to rate us or to leave a comment.Kadiatou: I want my child to go to Europe because there’s too much misery here, there’s no work.Rama: If my child leaves, he will send us money and all that we would want.Oumou: Every mother wishes for her son to travel. The boy is a man, he’s the pillar of the family. It’s him who supports his dad, his mother, his sisters and brothers. When the boy travels, that’s what can assure happiness.Danielle Olavario: We’re in Conakry, Guinea and these folks are talking about “the adventure” or “tounkan” in the local Malinké language.In Guinea, a country with a rich nomadic history and culture, “tounkan” is not just a word.It’s a way for a young man to learn about life.During the adventure you leave your parents’ house to find yourself alone, overcoming many hardships and even death to reach a better life in Europe.The goal?Succeed and become a hero or “tounkan namo” for your family.In other words, it’s the ultimate way for a boy to become a man.In Guinea, boys as young as 12-years-old leave their homes to go on illegal migration routes to Europe through the Mediterranean. Often, they are supported by their parents and whole villages.But what happens when the hero fails his adventure and has to return home and face the fierce reaction of his friends and family?Welcome to Cry Like a Boy, a podcast that explores how the pressure to be ‘a man’ can hurt families and societies. This is the fourth stop in our journey across the African continent, where we meet men who defy patriarchal norms.Today our story is about the pressure on young men to be successful, no matter the cost.Danielle Olavario: Guinea is a picturesque West African country with a population of 12 million people. The tropical climate of the country’s forest region allows it to grow high quality bananas, mangos and rice. Guinea is the world\\'s second export country for bauxite, after Russia.The country gained its independence from France in 1958. It hasn’t been involved in major international conflicts and for over 10 years there hasn’t been an active civil conflict on its territory.However, with a base salary of around 40 euros per month, the country remains among the world’s poorest.It’s also a place where young men are urged to go on “adventures” as a coming of age rite. Tens of thousands of Guineans try illegal migration routes each year. They make these long journeys on foot, often crossing deserts, finding routes by land and sea to make their way to Europe.Thousands of people die each year on the crossing.Despite the risk of thirst, hunger and violence in migration camps in Libya or in Moroccan prisons, many young people in Guinea dream of making this trip, of going on their own “adventure” to seek a better life, to become successful, and to make their families proud.But not everyone succeeds:Mamadou: The things I saw there, the things I went through, I wouldn’t wish them upon my enemy. I wouldn’t want him to go there.I went through many things there such as hunger, segregation, betrayal. I underwent forced labor there.Danielle Olavario: This is Mamadou Alpha. He prefers for people to call him Alpha. He is 21 years old. When we sit down to chat he offers a small plastic bag filled with mineral water. Coffee isn’t very popular here and most people just have mineral water of ginger juice. He seems like an easy-going and open guy, eager to tell his story, even if it’s a difficult one.Mamadou left home when he was 19 years old. He left with 1,100 euros from his family’s savings and went to Morocco in hopes to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.Since he was a boy growing up in Conakry, “ the adventure” was all he talked about with his friends. And those who successfully completed the trip inspire him to this day:Mamadou: Some of our friends live there. They never went to school even for a day, but they’re okay. I have a lot of friends there. Not long ago my friend who lives in France, in Lyon, paid for the wedding of his sister.Danielle Olavario: Friendly rivalry is a strong motivator for these boys. In their young imaginative minds, the ‘adventure’ is all about becoming a “Tounkan namo ” no matter the cost. We asked Ester Botta Somparé, an Italian anthropologist living in Guinea, to explain this phenomenon.Ester Botta Somparé: It is a kind of language that is presented in a very positive light, something that threatens human life. It\\'s impressive to hear the same words come up every time, trying to give value to the idea of leaving as an act of bravery, as an act of heroism.There was a mother I was talking to whose son left illegally. So this mother said she didn’t know her son wanted to leave, he never told her. He left secretly, but he was showing her pictures of his friends on social networks. He would say to her, \\'Look Mum, the real heroes at the moment are in Italy, Spain, they are in Europe. They are the ones who had the courage to make the crossing”. So there is this glorification that evokes fairy tales, that can indeed evoke initiation tales.Danielle Olavario: Mamadou lives in a modest two-story house with three other people: his mother Fatoumata, an older brother, and a younger adopted sister. Mamadou’s father, the breadwinner of the family, died several years ago, leaving Fatoumata and the whole family in a precarious position. This motivated the young Mamadou to consider making the journey himself.Mamadou: We have to go. We can’t see our families suffer here. We’ve been suffering since we’re kids. We’re supposed to have our own children in the future, so they shouldn’t see us in the same situation.Danielle Olavario: When a man of the family dies, women have several options here: marry their late husband’s relative so that the children keep the family name and stay together, or marry someone else. But that someone else may not want the children or may ban the children from seeing the late husband’s family.Fatoumata married Mamadou’s uncle. Mamadou thinks his uncle doesn’t take good care of his mother, so helping her is what pushed him to go on the Adventure.Mamadou: I know I’d do a lot for my mum because my mum did a lot for me.You know, in Africa, when you come into the world as a man, you have all the burdens hanging over your head.Danielle Olavario: Young men like Mamadou, feel the pressure to be successful breadwinners for the families once they come of age, and the adventure is part of that, but Guinea is not the only place putting such pressure on youths. Men around the world are “supposed” to be successful and take care of their families.Here’s Ester Botta Somparé again:Ester Botta Somparé: A man\\'s success is judged by his success in his professional field. It\\'s defined in terms of having power and maybe acquiring some wealth.The fact of taking care of one\\'s wife and children counts as well. This is something quite universal, even if in European and North American societies women are increasingly involved in the workforce, just like their husbands.The cultural specifics lie more in how important the obligations towards one\\'s family are, on the debt to one’s parents. So success would mean improving the living conditions of one\\'s family, repaying this debt to one’s parents for raising them, educating, feeding.Danielle Olavario: Success is important when it comes to the adventure. But what happens when you fail? After mentally preparing himself, Mamadou also made his attempt. But failing and returning home was even harder than the journey itself.Mamadou: When I came back people threw looks at me, some were talking behind my back, saying I was only having fun. Most people told me they knew I couldn\\'t do it. They said I was incapable of it, that I was weak. I don\\'t repent of anyone. I let it go. I know I am strong.Danielle Olavario: During his long journey, Mamadou was captured by the Moroccan authorities who sent him back home. To Mamadou this was a shock.Mamadou: I didn’t think I’d return to Guinea…with empty pockets.It was really, really, really painful. Really painful. Despite all the difficulties that I had in Morocco, I’d much rather stay there.Danielle Olavario: This is one of Mamadou’s relatives. He wishes to remain anonymous.Anonymous: If you’re a man, when you have a goal, either you achieve it or you die. But he was afraid to die, he returned. He spent so much money on this trip. If I were him, I would never return. I\\'d rather die there than return.Danielle Olavario: The shame of failure is something that none of these young men want to face. Especially when whole villages often chip in to collect enough for them to leave. So if they return, relatives and villagers often feel like these returnees have squandered their money…and they believe their failure means they did not become men...Anonymous: To me he\\'s a woman because it\\'s women who go back and forth. A man has a goal and he either achieves it or he doesn\\'t.The whole family relies on you. Going there and coming back means you haven\\'t reached your goal while the family counts on you, it\\'s you who is the man of the family.Danielle Olavario: Many people in Conakry share this opinion of Mamadou. This kind of stigma is the reason many migrants don’t dare come back.And if they do, many of them hide. Some of them even keep on sending money home, as if they were working abroad.Except, they live just around the corner.The “stigma of the returnee” follows both men and women when they have to return home from the Adventure. Men who return home are treated as weak and women are seen as cursed.With women, the stigma is connected to what they have to experience on their journey abroad. They often experience sexual abuse and rape, and sometimes they have no other choice but to sell their bodies in exchange of money or food.Bintou: It\\'s not easy at all. When a girl takes the route and she has no money, nothing... You need someone. And today, there is no free help. Someone can tell you he loves you but not because he does, only for his own benefit.I met someone on the road who told me he loved me and that he would take care of me. And yet, it was the other way round.Danielle Olavario: This is Bintou. She took the Moroccan route, like Mamadou. She came all the way to the coastal city of Nador, just 10km away from the Spanish border. But after struggling with love and work, she decided to come back. Even though for her, like for many women who return, it meant to be treated as “dirty”.Bintou: I didn\\'t care about what people thought when I came back. There was too much slander about me.They told me that maybe I was cursed by my parents, that is why I returned.Danielle Olavario: Bintou suffered from the very same stigma that hurt Mamadou.As a returnee, he was considered less of a man. He felt humiliated and wronged.But after two years, he found a way to cope with it.We are at a meeting of the Guinean Organisation Against Irregular Migration, an NGO created by returnees to help other returnees reintegrate into society. Their ultimate goal is to convince people to stay or make them migrate legally.We’re in a big room. In the center of this room, there is a big table with a dozen people. Some of them are women, but it’s mostly men. The ones who returned willingly or forcefully and those who are considering their options to leave.The host greets everyone and offers to choose the topic for a debate. Any topic. There are no rules. People come here to openly talk about what really bothers them.Elhadj Mohamed Diallo: Every month we have at least three or four educational debates with migrants and potential migrants. And sometimes we show them videos of young people who have never set foot anywhere, who don\\'t even know where Senegal is, but who have earned success in Guinea. We show this to the returnees so that they know that even if they left and came back, their lives aren’t over.Danielle Olavario: This was Elhadj Mohamed Diallo, president of this organization. The organization was created in 2018 and now operates in all Guinean regions. Every month they help dozens of families.According to him, some 19 000 people were forcefully returned to the country in the past four years, but the real number of returnees is impossible to calculate: some return voluntarily and don’t go through the system, some return secretly and never even tell their families they’re back.Man: I live in rejection. Why am I saying this? When you leave and return, your friends start to ignore you.Woman: Why do you think others ignore you?Danielle Olavario: Diallo says stigma of the returnees, is one of the biggest challenges for reintegration. Rejected by society, these people want to leave again, especially the men.It’s one of the reasons why the NGO suggests creating a televised competition with those who returned to highlight and empower these men and help them reassert their manhood through the series, showing the rest of the community how strong and useful they can be.Elhadj Mohamed Diallo: It makes them feel good. They get to see the young returnees as people with potential, also to defend their project because they have experienced a lot. Secondly, they have experience in many areas. So they have learned how to do many things. They have learned about many trades that don’t exist in Guinea, and they want to set up these trades.Danielle Olavario: NGOs like this one, supported by the International Organisation for Migration and the government, exist all over West Africa, where irregular migration is a major issue.But NGOs like these are not enough.But it isn’t the only solution. Here’s Mamadou again.Mamadou: Football is a hobby. Sometimes I feel like football helps me to forget a little bit what happened. When I\\'m on the pitch, I\\'m not alone, I\\'m with my friends. Sometimes we play with our elders. When it\\'s a good game, it\\'s good.In fact, it has already happened that my playmates laughed at me, but it makes me laugh, too. It\\'s good for me. If it’s during football, I don’t mind.Danielle Olavario: It is a really hot and sunny day. Mamadou is playing with four other men today. He’s wearing a yellow-green number 7 jersey. Around 30 people from the neighborhood came to watch the match. At the goal, they cheer.Here in Mamdou’s hometown, many boys dream of becoming the next Paul Pogba, star of the French National team, and Manchester United, a British Premier League club. Mamadou did too. Before he left, he was one of the strongest players in their team “Haut Niveau\\'\\'.The Alpha.He says that after coming back when people see him, they tend to think he’s gotten weaker. “Weak” is the word that follows him after he’s failed to get to Europe. But on the football field, he proves he is strong.He marks the second goal for his team and everyone cheers.Mamadou: I don\\'t always score, but when I score, I always show them that it\\'s me, it\\'s still me, Alpha. Alpha from before, the one who played the ball day and night before he came back, thinking it\\'s all over for him. I’m still the same Alpha.I feel very strong.Danielle Olavario: Mamadou Alpha had a difficult journey that has changed him. Football has helped him to reintegrate in society. Still, his biggest dream is still that of being the breadwinner for his household and making his mother proud.Mamadou: I dream of seeing my mum drive her own car. I did not want my mum to need anything. That was my dream. I wish my journey didn\\'t end. But I know that I will eventually reach my dream.It\\'s to get mum out of this poverty. That\\'s my idea, my biggest dream is that. To be my mum\\'s hero.Danielle Olavario: You were listening to Cry Like a Boy, a podcast in which we explore what it means to be a man in Africa.

After the death of his father, all he ever wanted was to get his mother out of poverty and become the perfect son, the family hero. At just 18, he embarked on an illegal migration route to Europe Guineans call “the adventure”, or “tounkan” in the local Malinké language.Thousands of African adventurers or “tounkan namo” die on these routes trying to cross the Mediterranean in search of a better life in Italy, Germany or France.Mamadou didn’t die. Yet he considers his fate was worse than death. After months of exhaustion, hunger, and forced labour during the “tounkan”, he was forcefully returned home and faced anger from family and friends.In the next episode on April 29, we will explore what happens to the adventurers who succeed and end up in Europe.At home, they’re proudly called “diaspo” from the word “diaspora”. The diaspo are usually treated with the utmost respect, they also have the biggest houses in the neighbourhood. But is being the hero that easy? And at what cost do they earn this respect?Cry Like a Boy is an original Euronews series and podcast that explores how the pressure to be ‘a man’ can harm families and entire societies. Stay with us as we travel across the African continent to meet men who are defying centuries-old gender stereotypes, and redefining their roles as men.The podcast is available in French under the name “Dans la tête des hommes”.Listen to us on Castbox, Spotify, Apple or wherever you listen to podcasts and don’t hesitate to rate us or to leave a comment.Kadiatou: I want my child to go to Europe because there’s too much misery here, there’s no work.Rama: If my child leaves, he will send us money and all that we would want.Oumou: Every mother wishes for her son to travel. The boy is a man, he’s the pillar of the family. It’s him who supports his dad, his mother, his sisters and brothers. When the boy travels, that’s what can assure happiness.Danielle Olavario: We’re in Conakry, Guinea and these folks are talking about “the adventure” or “tounkan” in the local Malinké language.In Guinea, a country with a rich nomadic history and culture, “tounkan” is not just a word.It’s a way for a young man to learn about life.During the adventure you leave your parents’ house to find yourself alone, overcoming many hardships and even death to reach a better life in Europe.The goal?Succeed and become a hero or “tounkan namo” for your family.In other words, it’s the ultimate way for a boy to become a man.In Guinea, boys as young as 12-years-old leave their homes to go on illegal migration routes to Europe through the Mediterranean. Often, they are supported by their parents and whole villages.But what happens when the hero fails his adventure and has to return home and face the fierce reaction of his friends and family?Welcome to Cry Like a Boy, a podcast that explores how the pressure to be ‘a man’ can hurt families and societies. This is the fourth stop in our journey across the African continent, where we meet men who defy patriarchal norms.Today our story is about the pressure on young men to be successful, no matter the cost.Danielle Olavario: Guinea is a picturesque West African country with a population of 12 million people. The tropical climate of the country’s forest region allows it to grow high quality bananas, mangos and rice. Guinea is the world\\'s second export country for bauxite, after Russia.The country gained its independence from France in 1958. It hasn’t been involved in major international conflicts and for over 10 years there hasn’t been an active civil conflict on its territory.However, with a base salary of around 40 euros per month, the country remains among the world’s poorest.It’s also a place where young men are urged to go on “adventures” as a coming of age rite. Tens of thousands of Guineans try illegal migration routes each year. They make these long journeys on foot, often crossing deserts, finding routes by land and sea to make their way to Europe.Thousands of people die each year on the crossing.Despite the risk of thirst, hunger and violence in migration camps in Libya or in Moroccan prisons, many young people in Guinea dream of making this trip, of going on their own “adventure” to seek a better life, to become successful, and to make their families proud.But not everyone succeeds:Mamadou: The things I saw there, the things I went through, I wouldn’t wish them upon my enemy. I wouldn’t want him to go there.I went through many things there such as hunger, segregation, betrayal. I underwent forced labor there.Danielle Olavario: This is Mamadou Alpha. He prefers for people to call him Alpha. He is 21 years old. When we sit down to chat he offers a small plastic bag filled with mineral water. Coffee isn’t very popular here and most people just have mineral water of ginger juice. He seems like an easy-going and open guy, eager to tell his story, even if it’s a difficult one.Mamadou left home when he was 19 years old. He left with 1,100 euros from his family’s savings and went to Morocco in hopes to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.Since he was a boy growing up in Conakry, “ the adventure” was all he talked about with his friends. And those who successfully completed the trip inspire him to this day:Mamadou: Some of our friends live there. They never went to school even for a day, but they’re okay.

Our goal is to enable audiences all around the world to deconstruct prejudices and to better understand gender issues in Africa.The podcast structure is fairly simple. First, we bring you tales of toxic and healthy masculinities with an original report from one African country, in collaboration with a journalist on the ground.There are two episodes per country. Then, we discuss the story from the documentary in-depth with two guests in two episodes.You are listening to the second part of the conversation that stems from the Lesotho documentary.Khopotso Bodibe: Welcome to Cry Like a Boy, a Euronews original podcast series dedicated to revealing stories of men who are defying centuries-old stereotypes in five different African countries.I am Khopotso Bodibe and I am a South African radio journalist and a professional who uses media for activism and advocacy around health and gender issues.If you are new to the show, this podcast explores how the pressure to be “a man” can harm families and society. After having travelled to Burundi and Senegal, today we continue a discussion that started off in Lesotho, a small enclave kingdom surrounded by South Africa.If you haven’t listened to the previous episodes, stop now and go back. You’ll hear the story of how the pressure to be a breadwinner for the family is destroying the lives of thousands of men and families in Lesotho, as men leave their homes to seek employment, ostensibly in an effort to provide for their families, in dangerous illegal mines in South Africa.Today we continue exploring this topic with Mpiwa Mangwiro. Mpiwa is based in Johannesburg and is an Advocacy Specialist for MenEngage Africa Alliance, fighting to achieve gender equality by including men and boys as part of the solution.We also invited to this podcast Rosalind Morris, who has taught anthropology at Columbia University for 25 years and has produced a documentary on the zama zama, the illegal miners who come to South Africa not just from Lesotho, but also from other neighbouring countries such as Botswana or Zimbabwe.We remind you that these interviews have been recorded at separate times.Khopotso Bodibe: In EP. 9 and 10 of this show, we heard from a man living in a rural and depopulated district of Lesotho, he tells us that all young boys around there “no longer look for safe, formal employment after finishing school, they all go to those illegal mines”. He has two sons, and he is afraid they will follow this path too. “Boys will always be boys and they may be interested in working in the zama-zama when they see others making a lot of money”.But is this true Rosalind?Rosalind Morris: You know, this is interesting, I asked people on the other side of the mines, and we know that very few people make any money. Hardly anything. The fantasy that one strikes it rich is ridiculous. Every once in a while, someone strikes it rich. What does this mean, really? It means that you might get forty-five hundred grand worth of gold. So three hundred US dollars worth of gold. You might live for four months on that.This is not rich, but the fantasy of this possibility is enormously powerful. It circulates like wildfire in this world. So when people say, oh, let\\'s go, we can get money quickly, we\\'ll bring it back, it\\'s the best way, this is going to be contradicted by experience very, very quickly and people have to live in the space of that contradiction. This is where the debt arises. This is where all of the anxiety about showing wealth that you don\\'t have arises.But when I ask people, why don\\'t you tell people back home that this is not real? They tell me something very interesting. They say that the very fact that one person does well or that someone is able to, for example, acquire a motorcycle or maybe can squat in a house that looks grander than what is available at home, that to deny anyone else the capacity to try for that would be considered by those other people to be an act of violence in and of itself, a foreclosure of that other group persons possible future.And so they\\'re willing to traffic in this fantasy, or at least not to reveal it for its duplicity. And this, I think, is a big part of the continuing industry. Nobody is getting very, very rich except perhaps a few gangsters and not just gangsters that you would imagine, you know. In the area where I work, I know there are white suburban residents who are asking the men who garden for them to take some money and buy gold and act as buyers and they become, you know, suburban gangsters who can take gold into a shop and sell it and have no questions asked.SOUNDBITE FROM THE DOCUMENTARY: WE ARE ZAMA ZAMAThey are not all constantly being robbed underground, but they are afraid of being robbed underground all the time.It happens people are press-ganged and you know, it\\'s a space where, as in so many informal communities, there are incredible forces, organised forces of criminality, and there\\'s everyone else who\\'s living in an effort to avoid it. And I think one of the big risks in the discourse about zama zama in South Africa is that these people are themselves the heart of the criminal problem, whereas in fact, these people, that is those who are going underground are primarily the victims of that criminal problem.Khopotso Bodibe: In some countries such as Zimbabwe, where the protagonists of Rosalind Morris’s documentary come from, the urban youth is crushed between structural poverty and unemployment while the rigid patriarchy is eager for emancipation. And young boys end up employed as zama zama in South Africa. I would like to address with Mpiwa the influence of this rigid patriarchy in such a delicate passage from adolescence to adult life. When are the first decisive choices made?Mpiwa Mangwiro: I think the reality is that when the passage between adolescence and young adulthood is that passage where people\\'s understanding of what is, and what is not acceptable, are really formed in that passage, which begins to heavily shape the environment that begins to heavily shape and define what is expected of individuals.So you find that when these rigid forms of masculinity, they are influences that put pressure on young men to begin to act in certain ways. For instance, without linking it to the extractive industries, I would link it to what used to happen in South Africa. That there was this norm that was accepted, that is at a certain age, a young teenager or a young man should have slept with a woman or should have slept with a girl.And if you have not done that, it was sort of like a disgrace to the boy code. So you find that that kind of rigid masculinity puts pressure on young men to begin to behave in certain ways that may be harmful to other members of society. We have high statistics of rape in South Africa, and when you trace it back, you find that some of the people who are adults now, and who are rapists now, are people who manifested or embraced it.That behaviour is a result of trying to live up to these rigid masculinities. So you find that in the same vein, young men end up being the zama zama, end up being caught up in criminal activities. What happens within this context is because they are trying to live up to the definition of what a man should be. Aggressive women and men should live up to this form of being aggressive, for being able to fight, being able to provide.And they begin to shape the perceptions of teenagers through to adulthood. And as time goes on, they become entrenched behaviours that they continue to manifest even as they progress in their adult years. And they\\'re also in checkmate, because what it means is if you cannot live up, if you are able to live up to that form of masculinity, you have now enslaved the way you have to continue to behave in that way for you to continue to retain the power and influence that you have as a man.And whereas if you can\\'t live up to that, it also then comes in emasculation, because you are not man enough. You are not a man. You are not living up to societal expectations. You\\'re not living up to the code of being a man. So you find that it also impacts young boys and teenagers into trying to behave in certain ways, some of which are also harmful for them. But because of society, peer pressure, and home, the things that they are exposed to and what they are seeing, their own families, their own communities around behaving the way that they are seeing them behaving, then they feel compelled to live up to that.And yet certainly they do need emancipation from that because that is entrapping them to perpetuate certain behaviours that are also toxic to them. The violence becomes toxic to them. That behaviour that they engage in becomes harmful to them and those around them, whereas those who cannot live up to those expectations live with the constant tag of feeling inadequate.Khopotso Bodibe: Contrary to what you would expect, however, the hyper-masculine space of the mine could be for many men a safe space to talk about issues they would not necessarily address in other environments. Rosalind Morris, what can you tell us about this?Rosalind Morris: I mean, people speak about it, sexual violence, as in all post-slaving, post-colonial societies is widespread among both white and black communities. But it\\'s especially widespread in communities where there\\'s no functioning state. I mean, basically, these are areas from which the state has withdrawn. Police don\\'t come, ambulance\\'s don\\'t come. There are very few services or any of the infrastructures of the state.So in that kind of space. You know, the person with the biggest d*ck gets to do what they want. And they do. And, you know, as with every community and all sorts of different positions on this, in my experience among the young men with whom I work, they\\'re extremely concerned about it. They talk about it a lot. They\\'re afraid both for the women in their lives and for themselves. They speak about both of these things. One of the young men with whom I work is very devoted to the idea of peer education. I use that formal term. He wouldn\\'t. That is, talking to other men his age about the need to fight sexual violence against women.So it\\'s very present. People don\\'t shy away from the discussion and they are enraged, actually, by the fact that they cannot call on the police or the state to help in moments when there is extreme sexual violence or any form of violence. And often that precipitates in more intense kinds of social conflict, I would say.Khopotso Bodibe: So what are the elements of toxic and healthy masculinity underground?Rosalind Morris: Well, I don\\'t know that it\\'s so easy to draw a line between toxic and healthy masculinity or whatever. What I would say is that underground I\\'ve heard young men talk a lot about what they inherit, you know, what traditions come to them and how much they are able to refuse what their elders did or what their elders want.And they are trying very hard to change themselves. I mean, this is the beginning of a movement away from anything that you might want to call toxic. And what we call toxic now won\\'t be the same in 20 years. But they know that some of the habits and patterns of their parental generations, sexual relations are not to be reproduced. And they think about it.I mean, it\\'s a huge range of people. Yeah, so for some young men, they feel that alcohol is a big problem. And for many young women as well, alcohol has deemed a kind of demon in the mix for force. For some people, the fact that you know, people are spread across the whole southern region, separated from each other, inevitably this is going to lead to multiple relations and multiple households.Well, when people are trying to support two or three households, everyone\\'s going to be in debt and things are going to collapse, but most of the people with whom I work are people who are in reasonably ordinary relationships, you know.They are there and they fear violence and they fear that kind of violence, which is borne of bravado. They speak about that, the kind of violence that is theatricalism. Where someone wants to demonstrate their strength by their capacity to injure someone else, that\\'s I think probably a key element. But they also live in a world where they themselves want to be known. So, you know, this desire for recognition can be either a positive force or an incredibly destructive force.Khopotso Bodibe: The world of zama zama is highly ethnicised. People speaking the same language or from the same ethnic minorities stick together. Professor Morris calls it “the terrible ghost of apartheid”. Everything in South Africa is ethnicised.And it’s important to understand that the notion of masculinity, but also what it means to be a man, differs in South Africa. What are the different forms of masculinity that live in South Africa nowadays? And what are the common challenges that overcome the heritage of segregation and apartheid? Mpiwa what do you think?Mpiwa Mangwiro: Thank you. I think I touched a bit on them, one of them being the hegemonic masculinity which sees all over things that it means to behave and men are supposed to be powerful means protective and supportive of aggressive and supposed to be.That\\'s one of the forms of masculinity that we see in the country. And unfortunately, because of the high statistics of rape and violence, we see that there\\'s a lot that comes from that. And then there\\'s another form, which is the complacent masculinity where it sort of complies with the hegemonic expectations because it does not challenge the status quo. You find that they are people who, while they may think that there\\'s something wrong with the violence, and so therefore they\\'re not challenging, they\\'re not doing anything about it, it\\'s not challenging the status quo.That is something that we are with, that we are also seeing. But then we are also seeing that there is also now a rise of this notion of trying to promote a positive form of masculinity where a number of organisations are not trying to be challenged to say you do not have to live up to these expectations because these expectations can harm you in these different forms that we have that I\\'ve been talking about. That sometimes drugs, you know, violence, this is all part of trying to live up to hegemonic masculinity.And yet it\\'s very toxic. And so you find that these are a challenge - also because of the country\\'s history, where there\\'s been a lot of absenteeism from a father\\'s legacy, there\\'s a lot of absent fathers left in the country because of its history with apartheid, where men had to leave home to also go fend in the mines and so forth, which created this gap - and young men end up having to give up, looking up to people whose forms of masculinity are not necessarily the best. And the country is still grappling and going through the process of then trying to move towards building positive forms of masculinity that depart from the harmful norms.But of course, it is a process because there is a lot that needs to be dismantled from those structures.Khopotso Bodibe: Professor Rosalind Morris, what are your thoughts on the role played by education in trying to fix some of the issues we just heard?Rosalind Morris: I\\'m an educator, so I believe in education. And I believe education is the only means by which people can change their minds.The people who are coming from Zimbabwe into the informal sectors and into the mining sector are often not as uneducated as you might imagine. College students come to work periodically to pay their fees. People who were hoping to finish school to go into ordinary kind of business tracks like tourism or hotel management or whatever, who found themselves cast out of school at the 11th, what we would call in here in the US, 11th grade, they are zama zama. There are always people who have only two or three years of education who are zama zama-ing. So it\\'s a hugely diverse group and there are all sorts of different levels of educationSOUNDBITE FROM THE DOCUMENTARY: WE ARE ZAMA ZAMARosalind Morris: Unfortunately, because so many of these people are now illegal migrants in South Africa, their children cannot get access to schooling. And this is a new generation that is going to have a fragmented ad hoc education. I think that\\'s a huge problem for the future as much as the lack of education was a problem in the past. The migrants from Zambia, from Zimbabwe and Botswana are not as uneducated, but their children will be.OUTROKhopotso Bodibe: This show has been produced by me, Khopotso Bodibe, in Johannesburg; Pascalinah Khabi in Maseru, Lesotho; and Lillo Montalto-Monella, Marta Rodríguez-Martinez, Naira Davlashyan, Arwa Barkallah and Mame Peya Diaw, in Lyon.Special thanks go to Lory Martinez, Clizia Sala and Studio Ochenta for helping us produce this podcast.

You are not a man. You are not living up to societal expectations. You\\'re not living up to the code of being a man. So you find that it also impacts young boys and teenagers into trying to behave in certain ways, some of which are also harmful for them. But because of society, peer pressure, and home, the things that they are exposed to and what they are seeing, their own families, their own communities around behaving the way that they are seeing them behaving, then they feel compelled to live up to that.And yet certainly they do need emancipation from that because that is entrapping them to perpetuate certain behaviours that are also toxic to them. The violence becomes toxic to them. That behaviour that they engage in becomes harmful to them and those around them, whereas those who cannot live up to those expectations live with the constant tag of feeling inadequate.Khopotso Bodibe: Contrary to what you would expect, however, the hyper-masculine space of the mine could be for many men a safe space to talk about issues they would not necessarily address in other environments. Rosalind Morris, what can you tell us about this?Rosalind Morris: I mean, people speak about it, sexual violence, as in all post-slaving, post-colonial societies is widespread among both white and black communities. But it\\'s especially widespread in communities where there\\'s no functioning state. I mean, basically, these are areas from which the state has withdrawn. Police don\\'t come, ambulance\\'s don\\'t come. There are very few services or any of the infrastructures of the state.So in that kind of space. You know, the person with the biggest d*ck gets to do what they want. And they do. And, you know, as with every community and all sorts of different positions on this, in my experience among the young men with whom I work, they\\'re extremely concerned about it. They talk about it a lot. They\\'re afraid both for the women in their lives and for themselves. They speak about both of these things. One of the young men with whom I work is very devoted to the idea of peer education. I use that formal term. He wouldn\\'t. That is, talking to other men his age about the need to fight sexual violence against women.So it\\'s very present. People don\\'t shy away from the discussion and they are enraged, actually, by the fact that they cannot call on the police or the state to help in moments when there is extreme sexual violence or any form of violence. And often that precipitates in more intense kinds of social conflict, I would say.Khopotso Bodibe: So what are the elements of toxic and healthy masculinity underground?Rosalind Morris: Well, I don\\'t know that it\\'s so easy to draw a line between toxic and healthy masculinity or whatever. What I would say is that underground I\\'ve heard young men talk a lot about what they inherit, you know, what traditions come to them and how much they are able to refuse what their elders did or what their elders want.And they are trying very hard to change themselves. I mean, this is the beginning of a movement away from anything that you might want to call toxic. And what we call toxic now won\\'t be the same in 20 years. But they know that some of the habits and patterns of their parental generations, sexual relations are not to be reproduced. And they think about it.I mean, it\\'s a huge range of people. Yeah, so for some young men, they feel that alcohol is a big problem. And for many young women as well, alcohol has deemed a kind of demon in the mix for force. For some people, the fact that you know, people are spread across the whole southern region, separated from each other, inevitably this is going to lead to multiple relations and multiple households.Well, when people are trying to support two or three households, everyone\\'s going to be in debt and things are going to collapse, but most of the people with whom I work are people who are in reasonably ordinary relationships, you know.They are there and they fear violence and they fear that kind of violence, which is borne of bravado. They speak about that, the kind of violence that is theatricalism. Where someone wants to demonstrate their strength by their capacity to injure someone else, that\\'s I think probably a key element. But they also live in a world where they themselves want to be known. So, you know, this desire for recognition can be either a positive force or an incredibly destructive force.Khopotso Bodibe: The world of zama zama is highly ethnicised. People speaking the same language or from the same ethnic minorities stick together. Professor Morris calls it “the terrible ghost of apartheid”. Everything in South Africa is ethnicised.And it’s important to understand that the notion of masculinity, but also what it means to be a man, differs in South Africa. What are the different forms of masculinity that live in South Africa nowadays? And what are the common challenges that overcome the heritage of segregation and apartheid? Mpiwa what do you think?Mpiwa Mangwiro: Thank you. I think I touched a bit on them, one of them being the hegemonic masculinity which sees all over things that it means to behave and men are supposed to be powerful means protective and supportive of aggressive and supposed to be.That\\'s one of the forms of masculinity that we see in the country. And unfortunately, because of the high statistics of rape and violence, we see that there\\'s a lot that comes from that. And then there\\'s another form, which is the complacent masculinity where it sort of complies with the hegemonic expectations because it does not challenge the status quo. You find that they are people who, while they may think that there\\'s something wrong with the violence, and so therefore they\\'re not challenging, they\\'re not doing anything about it, it\\'s not challenging the status quo.That is something that we are with, that we are also seeing. But then we are also seeing that there is also now a rise of this notion of trying to promote a positive form of masculinity where a number of organisations are not trying to be challenged to say you do not have to live up to these expectations because these expectations can harm you in these different forms that we have that I\\'ve been talking about. That sometimes drugs, you know, violence, this is all part of trying to live up to hegemonic masculinity.And yet it\\'s very toxic. And so you find that these are a challenge - also because of the country\\'s history, where there\\'s been a lot of absenteeism from a father\\'s legacy, there\\'s a lot of absent fathers left in the country because of its history with apartheid, where men had to leave home to also go fend in the mines and so forth, which created this gap - and young men end up having to give up, looking up to people whose forms of masculinity are not necessarily the best. And the country is still grappling and going through the process of then trying to move towards building positive forms of masculinity that depart from the harmful norms.But of course, it is a process because there is a lot that needs to be dismantled from those structures.Khopotso Bodibe: Professor Rosalind Morris, what are your thoughts on the role played by education in trying to fix some of the issues we just heard?Rosalind Morris: I\\'m an educator, so I believe in education. And I believe education is the only means by which people can change their minds.The people who are coming from Zimbabwe into the informal sectors and into the mining sector are often not as uneducated as you might imagine. College students come to work periodically to pay their fees. People who were hoping to finish school to go into ordinary kind of business tracks like tourism or hotel management or whatever, who found themselves cast out of school at the 11th, what we would call in here in the US, 11th grade, they are zama zama. There are always people who have only two or three years of education who are zama zama-ing. So it\\'s a hugely diverse group and there are all sorts of different levels of educationSOUNDBITE FROM THE DOCUMENTARY: WE ARE ZAMA ZAMARosalind Morris: Unfortunately, because so many of these people are now illegal migrants in South Africa, their children cannot get access to schooling. And this is a new generation that is going to have a fragmented ad hoc education. I think that\\'s a huge problem for the future as much as the lack of education was a problem in the past. The migrants from Zambia, from Zimbabwe and Botswana are not as uneducated, but their children will be.OUTROKhopotso Bodibe: This show has been produced by me, Khopotso Bodibe, in Johannesburg; Pascalinah Khabi in Maseru, Lesotho; and Lillo Montalto-Monella, Marta Rodríguez-Martinez, Naira Davlashyan, Arwa Barkallah and Mame Peya Diaw, in Lyon.Special thanks go to Lory Martinez, Clizia Sala and Studio Ochenta for helping us produce this podcast.

Even our home is a place of power, and traditionally it is managed by a female figure. Women are entrusted with the task of care, and men instead are tasked with maintaining and protecting that place.The pandemic emergency has put a great deal of stress upon this norm, and the situation has become indeed extremely complicated.When we cannot go out anymore to carry out our daily activities elsewhere, it is necessary to achieve a careful redistribution of time, space and power.Home was necessarily being transformed by the pandemic into a workplace, but also in a place of relaxation and disengagement (when possible). Those domestic spaces - usually shared only for a few moments a day - are becoming the places where we live together for the whole day.The role of the breadwinner is strongly undermined by the obligation to work at home, because when at home it is much more complicated to demonstrate one\\'s role to colleagues and co-workers. There is no office, no common space divided by areas and sectors, no uniform, no codified symbology to remind us of a hierarchy.This hierarchy has dematerialized into a digital world that is much more complex to manage, based in part on the memory of previous experiences but now placed in more abstract languages, and in more complex and structured types of communication.For those accustomed to a more gestural, direct, vocal, and physical kind of communication, this new normality could be a real source of frustration.In the context of family relationships, dominant positions are getting more complicated too.The worker used to perform grand gestures such as \"leaving the house\", but now has to remain within the domestic walls, in front of a screen - something that resembles a playful activity, a pastime, but surely not a job.This symbolism strikes everyone else living in the same house, too.They get a different perspective on an activity that used to be carried outside, wrapped in that mysterious but reassuring phrase: \"How was work today?\".The role of the breadwinner gets somehow diminished. That conversation (“How was work today?”) that triggers human contact, becomes now difficult to have - especially when you get to see the partner “working” in front of you for the whole day.And what if the breadwinner loses the job?Despite these dramatic changes imposed on our lives by the pandemic, the inertia of traditional gender roles tends to keep the management of them in the hands of the same person, especially for less pleasant tasks like cleaning or feeding.As last year taught us, on average men are less prepared for this change, while women - unfortunately for them - are far more trained in the mental load required to move between different tasks and responsibilities.Neither of the two is used to managing the power conflict that inevitably arises.Disturbing statistics tell us that, almost certainly, it has been the woman who has lost her job - if she had one -, or has seen it greatly reduced. On top of this, she now has to take on the management of a more inhabited house - therefore dirtier, more used, hungrier -, while everyone else in the house would accumulate their difficulties in the same domestic place.The general stress rate quickly rises to very high levels because of a closed school (sometimes considered a nice \"parking lot\" for children), or caretaking tasks suddenly increasing exponentially, while our freedom and emotional relationships are being compromised.The mere idea of looking for an alternative escape valve - you can\\'t go out, there are no sports and gyms available to you - sounds like a further, unbearable commitment.In this overpopulated, domestic microcosm that is noisier, tighter and dirtier, traditional roles gave to each inhabitant of the house a precise hierarchical position - elastic and criticizable, certainly, but yet defined. Now they have no meaning anymore, they have been blown apart.Boundaries can no longer contain, lines of respect have been crossed, and previously contained and controlled energies are now free to circulate.When we try avoiding conflict by sticking to the rigidity of our gender roles, we run the risk of making it explode instead.Managing conflict means first of all recognizing it as inevitable. Then, it means being ready and willing to re-discuss those roles typically associated with gender, redraw their limits, reorganize tasks and cohabitation.If our space becomes more of a common space, we would need to live that space through a more shared language (both verbal and non-verbal).By changing those habits we believe are part of our identities, we do not stop being a man or a woman.Everyone has to acknowledge all conditioning factors and pressures, and be ready to reevaluate them, thus avoiding them to be a burden for the other person.We need not to harm the lives of those we share a restricted time and place with. That doesn\\'t make us less of a man or less of a woman.Different cultures will have different solutions available, due to the different effects that the pandemic has had in each society.However, one cannot recklessly hold on to maintaining traditional gender roles.They were already widely criticized “before\" the pandemic, and that time will not return.Traditional gender roles are getting more senseless in our uncertain and destabilizing \"present\", and they will be even more useless in the aftermath, when we will need to reimagine and reconstruct our future in a different fashion.The resources for this reconfiguration and rediscussion of gender identities have been there for a long time.Borrowing a well-known political slogan, there is no better time than now to put them at work, and make them the common heritage of our communities.Lorenzo Gasparrini has devoted himself to topics regarding gender studies, especially aimed at a male audience. He conducts seminars, workshops and laboratories in universities, companies and schools, and publishes both online and in print.____________Opinions expressed in View articles are solely those of the authors.Are you a recognized expert in your field working in Africa?

But for others, this dangerous choice entails unrestricted freedom and the possibility of being the makers of their own destiny. After all, miners bringing home the big bucks are the envy of all their peers.In the last two episodes of Cry Like a Boy - a podcast dedicated to exploring the pressures linked to \"being a man\" - you heard the stories of the brothers of darkness from Lesotho.Men who are willing to put their lives at risk underground to put bread on the table for their loved ones.We believe these forgotten stories push to the extreme a certain kind of pressure that almost everyone feels around the world: the pressure of being a breadwinner.During episodes 11 and 12 of Cry Like a Boy, we sit down for a moment of reflection and talk about the unknown world of the zama zama with two guests: Mpiwa Mangwiro, who has explored the social consequences of the extractive industry in South Africa in her role as Advocacy Specialist for MenEngage Africa Alliance; and Rosalind Morris, an award-winning anthropologist who has launched a project devoted to the zama zama, featuring a documentary and several short films.Our guests touch upon the condition of the women of the zama zama - performing some of the most dangerous tasks in Africa\\'s abandoned mines - but also on the positive forms of masculinities that emerge from underground.Down there, as days and months go by seeking gold, men are discovering true bonds, friendships, and an enormous amount of creative energy.Cry Like a Boy is an original Euronews podcast that aims at promoting a cross-border discussion on gender roles. Our goal is to enable audiences all around the world to deconstruct prejudices and to better understand gender issues in Africa.The podcast structure is fairly simple. First, we bring you tales of toxic and healthy masculinities with an original reportage from one African country, in collaboration with a journalist on the ground. Two episodes per country. Then, we discuss the story heard in the documentary with two guests for the next two episodes.What you are hearing here is the first part of the conversation that stems from the Lesotho documentary.Khopotso Bodibe: I am Khopotso Bodibe with you from Johannesburg, in South Africa. In the last two episodes, we heard the stories of Banna Ba Mamainara, the Lesotho men who leave their country to work in South African mines as zama zama, clandestine or illegal miners.As you might imagine, sometimes it gets quite hard to produce a podcast in pandemic time.Today you won’t hear the recording of a live conversation with our guests, but we had to record the two interviews in separate moments.Our first guest is Mpiwa Mangwiro, based in Johannesburg, just like me. Mpiwa Mangwiro champions gender equality in South Africa from both sides of the divide - driven by the belief that gender inequality is harmful to both women and men. She believes equality cannot be achieved if men and boys are excluded from efforts to attain it.Our second guest is Rosalind Morris, a Canadian anthropologist who has taught at Columbia University for 25 years. Madame Morris produced a documentary called We are Zama Zama, part of a bigger multi-format project. This documentary talks exactly about the story you just heard in the last two episodes but featuring protagonists coming from Zimbabwe instead of Lesotho. With some significant differences, as you will hear.We chose to focus on the story of the zama zama as one of the biggest pressures all men around the world feel is to provide, to put food on the table for their families. Being breadwinners.But let’s first meet these zama zama. Understand who they are, exactly.Khopotso Bodibe: Rosalind Morris; Just bringing you in here, what you can tell us about these young men?Rosalind Morris: There are people with very different life trajectories, but they know each other, speak the same language. They share the predicament of being marginalised and in fact, I would say oppressed. They are members of an oppressed minority community in Zimbabwe and they share the predicament of economic destitution, which has led so many minority people in Zimbabwe to have to flee to look for work in adjacent countries.These are people who are following the same routes that their forebears followed for generations. And, as in the past, that kind of cyclic migration means that people have families in at least two places, often many, many more, they\\'re spread out across all of southern Africa. They maintain intense relations with those people. You know, in the age of social media, they\\'re WhatsApping each other just as much as we\\'re Zooming each other.They\\'re sending small remittances back home if they can. But that\\'s not very likely for people on the bottom rung.Khopotso Bodibe: Here in South Africa, Mpiwa Mangwiro explored the social consequences of the extractive industry, an industry that since the old times is deeply connected with masculinity. Mpiwa, what are the different pressures that it brings on different genders?Mpiwa Mangwiro: The extractive industry has had an impact, a differential impact on the different genders, if we\\'re to put it that way. Because when you look at it, as I said, it\\'s an industry that in South Africa, it has serviced in a number of countries.There is normally an expectation that the men should be the provider. It is often men who have to leave home and have to come and work in this industry because this is a labour-intensive industry.So there\\'s always also that assumption that men are physically stronger and more capable than women to function in this industry. So you find that it is the men who have had to leave the home. And when talking in the context of Lesotho, it\\'s the men who had to leave their homes in Lesotho because of the pressure and the expectation on them to provide for their families. They have to walk away from the families to come and find their footing in this industry, which is its own different forms of violence because of the different masculinities that image and also that interact during the process of establishing oneself in this industry.You find that sometimes men also go through a lot of violence even as they try to establish themselves as miners through legal or illegal means. And you also find that what is then created is an absence or a vacuum, when they leave home to come and work in these environments or in these mining places.They leave a family behind - which family now needs to learn to fend for itself in the absence of this provider? Often it\\'s the women, who are left behind by these men, who now have to step up and also find means of trying to fend for the family while this man is away working whatever he can, which is expected to send home. But the reality is... because often these men are away from home for quite a long time, they end up helping other families.So you find that what would result is that this man has left Lesotho. When he left Lesotho, he had a wife and a family there. He comes to this mining town. He ends up meeting another woman. And in the end, he also establishes another family there. So instead of being able to fend and send and take care of the family that has been left in Lesotho, now he has a responsibility to also take care of this family that is with him in this mining town, the resulting issue being another form of conflict.When he eventually goes back home to Lesotho, he\\'s not carrying much, which is expected of him as a provider. It means that he is also leaving another family behind, that now he has to live with an absent father who has gone back to the other family. And the women have to step up in those families most times. They have to also step up and play that role that is often associated with the men in their absence.Khopotso Bodibe: Thank you Mpiwa. Women do play an important role in this story. And it is not at all a passive role. When they are married to zama zama and choose to follow them to the mines, they end up putting their lives at risk exactly as their husbands do. Rosalind Morris, what are the ways in which these jobs affect women?Rosalind Morris: For those that have spouses in South Africa, in my experience, it\\'s quite unusual for the women who are married to zama zama to be involved in the other kind of work that is often done around the big, the deep-level mines, women do a lot of work around those mines. They are crushing rock. They\\'re doing the most labour-intensive and frankly, some of the most dangerous work because they are crushing rock that is full of quartz and crystal and they are basically breathing ground glass all the time. So it\\'s an incredibly dangerous job that they have. An arduous one. But most men who go underground prefer it if their wives are not working on those crushing fields. When I call the crushing fields and most women who can avoid it, avoid that job, too. So they may work as piece workers, they may take jobs as domestics, they may work in little kiosks or gardens that they sell to, to the market, all that. So it\\'s a pretty heterogeneous world.Khopotso Bodibe: On this point, Mpiwa Mangwiro same question to you.Mpiwa Mangwiro: You find that women have also been trying to find their way, and they\\'ve also been trying to be involved in the extractive industry. But because of the nature of violence that sometimes comes with this, then certainly they become victims because it\\'s difficult. They suffer multiple forms of abuse. Within the mining towns, we know that when women try to come and be involved in the trade, sometimes they end up having to find themselves getting into commercial sex work, sometimes intentionally, but sometimes unintentionally.They find that these are the options that they have found, but also you find that the women who have been left home now find themselves in a position where they have to step up.But it\\'s also because there was an expectation, both from men and from women, that the men should provide, which is steaming out of our societal and gender norms that have always defined or tend to define men as the provider. So is that woman has also had an expectation on her men to provide, then when the men leave, you find that women then find themselves having to carry this responsibility and having to face some of the multiple forms of challenges and abuses that they face.So, yes, they are also victims but is also a part where they also try to play a part. But unfortunately, because of the nature of how sometimes harmful gender norms, toxic masculinity, and societal expectations play out, then they end up also being victims in the process.Khopotso Bodibe: If we can just get back to the question of breadwinning. The reason these young men leave South Africa is that they feel the pressure of being breadwinners. Let’s talk a bit about this Mpiwa, what are your thoughts? What do you see?Mpiwa Mangwiro: So what happens is that there is this general tendency to expect that a typical man is a man, you know, the hegemonic masculinity. And a typical man is a man who\\'s supposed to provide to provide shelter, to provide food, to provide clothing, to be able to protect their family. That\\'s the kind of expectation from society over the definition of a typical man. So what you then find is because Lesotho is a country that also has its fair share of economic challenges, the reality is sometimes the opportunities for men to be able to play that role where they can be gainfully employed and be able to provide for their families is limited.And they find themselves having to cross over to South Africa where there\\'s been a thriving extractive industry or thriving mining expectations. In that decision, when men make that decision, it is because they are trying to live up to those expectations. They are trying to live up to that pressure where they are saying they need to go and find means of provision. So what becomes particularly... you are talking where people have not noted a high form of education, for them to try and look for formal employment, the next available thing that they can do for them is to come and join the work in the mines.So first of all, this is the pressure that is put on a man. That is, as a man, you\\'ve got to provide. You\\'ve got to find a way. If you are not able to provide, then you are not good enough as a man. Or if you have no means of taking care of this family, you are not good enough as a man, which also creates this form of emasculation that comes with not being able to live up to this societal expectation of being able to provide.So even the young men have this pressure that they need to cross the borders and go find employment so that they can be able to provide, so that they can be able to have money to pay for the dowry price for their wives. So that\\'s the pressure that it brings, if you are not able to make the provision, then you are not man enough.And also the other pressure is because the extractive industry is also coming with its own challenges. There\\'s a lot of wars. There\\'s a lot of fights that are happening in that process as men try to establish themselves and set their feet in this. Sometimes they are forced. They find themselves put in a place where they are forced to commit crimes so that they can be able to get protection or to be able to survive and sustain themselves in that environment. So this is the physical pressure that is on the men.Khopotso Bodibe: But down there in the mines it is not all about toxic masculinity and harmful behaviours. Rosalind Morris, drawing from her decade-long experience investigating the world of zama zama from Zimbabwe explains.Rosalind Morris: These are people who are living on the absolute threshold of livability, right? But they are not people who consider themselves to be without choice. In fact, it\\'s very important to recognise that for people who work as zama zama, this is often thought to be a sovereign choice because they are not working for other people - or this is the story they tell - because they can work when they wish to earn enough to survive.And then, when they are able to, when they have enough accumulated, they will stop going underground for a while, then pick it up again when they need it.It\\'s got a rhythm, the rhythm of need, and they pursue that. But it\\'s also important to realise that their lives are not completely abject. You know, there\\'s an enormous amount of creative energy. There\\'s great pleasure underground. People listen to music, they eat together, they sleep together. They spend days underground and in really intense social life and not just scrambling for the tiniest morsel or the smallest bit of money.So they have a very, very intense bond underground, people who work together in teams who know each other, usually who come from the same community, who speak the same language.I mean, you have to understand that five or six or seven languages might be spoken by different groups underground in any mine. But that bond is sort of proven in the moment that someone is injured or killed underground and they will do anything to bring that body up and they will do almost anything to ensure that that body is returned to its home so it can be reconciled with ancestors.I mean, it is often a huge, huge risk and cost. They will spend all their savings, all the savings they\\'ve saved to go home to transport a body. And you could say in one way that that\\'s a kind of dense social node of solidarity and fraternity. And it also works in some ways as the inversion of the funeral societies, because instead of allowing people to save money and share it in moments of need, it basically is dissipated with every catastrophe.Khopotso Bodibe: Thank you for listening to Cry Like a Boy.

But for others, this dangerous choice entails unrestricted freedom and the possibility of being the makers of their own destiny. After all, miners bringing home the big bucks are the envy of all their peers.In the last two episodes of Cry Like a Boy - a podcast dedicated to exploring the pressures linked to \"being a man\" - you heard the stories of the brothers of darkness from Lesotho.Men who are willing to put their lives at risk underground to put bread on the table for their loved ones.We believe these forgotten stories push to the extreme a certain kind of pressure that almost everyone feels around the world: the pressure of being a breadwinner.During episodes 11 and 12 of Cry Like a Boy, we sit down for a moment of reflection and talk about the unknown world of the zama zama with two guests: Mpiwa Mangwiro, who has explored the social consequences of the extractive industry in South Africa in her role as Advocacy Specialist for MenEngage Africa Alliance; and Rosalind Morris, an award-winning anthropologist who has launched a project devoted to the zama zama, featuring a documentary and several short films.Our guests touch upon the condition of the women of the zama zama - performing some of the most dangerous tasks in Africa\\'s abandoned mines - but also on the positive forms of masculinities that emerge from underground.Down there, as days and months go by seeking gold, men are discovering true bonds, friendships, and an enormous amount of creative energy.Cry Like a Boy is an original Euronews podcast that aims at promoting a cross-border discussion on gender roles. Our goal is to enable audiences all around the world to deconstruct prejudices and to better understand gender issues in Africa.The podcast structure is fairly simple. First, we bring you tales of toxic and healthy masculinities with an original reportage from one African country, in collaboration with a journalist on the ground. Two episodes per country. Then, we discuss the story heard in the documentary with two guests for the next two episodes.What you are hearing here is the first part of the conversation that stems from the Lesotho documentary.Khopotso Bodibe: I am Khopotso Bodibe with you from Johannesburg, in South Africa. In the last two episodes, we heard the stories of Banna Ba Mamainara, the Lesotho men who leave their country to work in South African mines as zama zama, clandestine or illegal miners.As you might imagine, sometimes it gets quite hard to produce a podcast in pandemic time.Today you won’t hear the recording of a live conversation with our guests, but we had to record the two interviews in separate moments.Our first guest is Mpiwa Mangwiro, based in Johannesburg, just like me. Mpiwa Mangwiro champions gender equality in South Africa from both sides of the divide - driven by the belief that gender inequality is harmful to both women and men. She believes equality cannot be achieved if men and boys are excluded from efforts to attain it.Our second guest is Rosalind Morris, a Canadian anthropologist who has taught at Columbia University for 25 years. Madame Morris produced a documentary called We are Zama Zama, part of a bigger multi-format project. This documentary talks exactly about the story you just heard in the last two episodes but featuring protagonists coming from Zimbabwe instead of Lesotho. With some significant differences, as you will hear.We chose to focus on the story of the zama zama as one of the biggest pressures all men around the world feel is to provide, to put food on the table for their families. Being breadwinners.But let’s first meet these zama zama. Understand who they are, exactly.Khopotso Bodibe: Rosalind Morris; Just bringing you in here, what you can tell us about these young men?Rosalind Morris: There are people with very different life trajectories, but they know each other, speak the same language. They share the predicament of being marginalised and in fact, I would say oppressed. They are members of an oppressed minority community in Zimbabwe and they share the predicament of economic destitution, which has led so many minority people in Zimbabwe to have to flee to look for work in adjacent countries.These are people who are following the same routes that their forebears followed for generations. And, as in the past, that kind of cyclic migration means that people have families in at least two places, often many, many more, they\\'re spread out across all of southern Africa. They maintain intense relations with those people. You know, in the age of social media, they\\'re WhatsApping each other just as much as we\\'re Zooming each other.They\\'re sending small remittances back home if they can. But that\\'s not very likely for people on the bottom rung.Khopotso Bodibe: Here in South Africa, Mpiwa Mangwiro explored the social consequences of the extractive industry, an industry that since the old times is deeply connected with masculinity. Mpiwa, what are the different pressures that it brings on different genders?Mpiwa Mangwiro: The extractive industry has had an impact, a differential impact on the different genders, if we\\'re to put it that way. Because when you look at it, as I said, it\\'s an industry that in South Africa, it has serviced in a number of countries.There is normally an expectation that the men should be the provider. It is often men who have to leave home and have to come and work in this industry because this is a labour-intensive industry.So there\\'s always also that assumption that men are physically stronger and more capable than women to function in this industry. So you find that it is the men who have had to leave the home. And when talking in the context of Lesotho, it\\'s the men who had to leave their homes in Lesotho because of the pressure and the expectation on them to provide for their families. They have to walk away from the families to come and find their footing in this industry, which is its own different forms of violence because of the different masculinities that image and also that interact during the process of establishing oneself in this industry.You find that sometimes men also go through a lot of violence even as they try to establish themselves as miners through legal or illegal means. And you also find that what is then created is an absence or a vacuum, when they leave home to come and work in these environments or in these mining places.They leave a family behind - which family now needs to learn to fend for itself in the absence of this provider? Often it\\'s the women, who are left behind by these men, who now have to step up and also find means of trying to fend for the family while this man is away working whatever he can, which is expected to send home. But the reality is... because often these men are away from home for quite a long time, they end up helping other families.So you find that what would result is that this man has left Lesotho. When he left Lesotho, he had a wife and a family there. He comes to this mining town. He ends up meeting another woman. And in the end, he also establishes another family there. So instead of being able to fend and send and take care of the family that has been left in Lesotho, now he has a responsibility to also take care of this family that is with him in this mining town, the resulting issue being another form of conflict.When he eventually goes back home to Lesotho, he\\'s not carrying much, which is expected of him as a provider. It means that he is also leaving another family behind, that now he has to live with an absent father who has gone back to the other family. And the women have to step up in those families most times. They have to also step up and play that role that is often associated with the men in their absence.Khopotso Bodibe: Thank you Mpiwa. Women do play an important role in this story. And it is not at all a passive role. When they are married to zama zama and choose to follow them to the mines, they end up putting their lives at risk exactly as their husbands do. Rosalind Morris, what are the ways in which these jobs affect women?Rosalind Morris: For those that have spouses in South Africa, in my experience, it\\'s quite unusual for the women who are married to zama zama to be involved in the other kind of work that is often done around the big, the deep-level mines, women do a lot of work around those mines. They are crushing rock. They\\'re doing the most labour-intensive and frankly, some of the most dangerous work because they are crushing rock that is full of quartz and crystal and they are basically breathing ground glass all the time. So it\\'s an incredibly dangerous job that they have. An arduous one. But most men who go underground prefer it if their wives are not working on those crushing fields. When I call the crushing fields and most women who can avoid it, avoid that job, too. So they may work as piece workers, they may take jobs as domestics, they may work in little kiosks or gardens that they sell to, to the market, all that. So it\\'s a pretty heterogeneous world.Khopotso Bodibe: On this point, Mpiwa Mangwiro same question to you.Mpiwa Mangwiro: You find that women have also been trying to find their way, and they\\'ve also been trying to be involved in the extractive industry. But because of the nature of violence that sometimes comes with this, then certainly they become victims because it\\'s difficult. They suffer multiple forms of abuse. Within the mining towns, we know that when women try to come and be involved in the trade, sometimes they end up having to find themselves getting into commercial sex work, sometimes intentionally, but sometimes unintentionally.They find that these are the options that they have found, but also you find that the women who have been left home now find themselves in a position where they have to step up.But it\\'s also because there was an expectation, both from men and from women, that the men should provide, which is steaming out of our societal and gender norms that have always defined or tend to define men as the provider. So is that woman has also had an expectation on her men to provide, then when the men leave, you find that women then find themselves having to carry this responsibility and having to face some of the multiple forms of challenges and abuses that they face.So, yes, they are also victims but is also a part where they also try to play a part. But unfortunately, because of the nature of how sometimes harmful gender norms, toxic masculinity, and societal expectations play out, then they end up also being victims in the process.Khopotso Bodibe: If we can just get back to the question of breadwinning.

We live in a patriarchal system.\"Share this articleIn Europe, we are used to hearing the stories of the poorest and most marginalised people in Africa only when tragedy strikes. For example, we only hear about miners - men and women who would stop at nothing to feed their families - when something catastrophic happens underground.But have you ever wondered how these people feel? What kind of pressure do they have to face on a daily basis? And, most importantly, what are the consequences for the families left behind, when their breadwinner is willing to do whatever it takes to put bread on the table?As part of its Cry Like a Boy series, Euronews follows up the publication of two exclusive podcast documentaries with this video testimony that sheds a unique light on the plight of Lesotho\\'s mining families.In this video (click ⬆ on the player above) we tell the story of one such family, the Tlali family.The man of the house, Motoana Tlali, dreamt of becoming a businessman but had to give up all his dreams when poverty struck after the death of his father.At 21, he left home for a gold mine in South Africa, where he worked, digging and shoveling, for the next 32 years of his life - hating the underground work \"with every one of my fibres\".Down there, he saw the worst. One day, 14 of his colleagues perished right in front of him in a terrible accident. Motoana Tlali was the only survivor of a 15-man squad.When we met up with him, at his home in the Bela-Bela Constituency of Berea, he told us those wounds were still fresh. He still had nightmares, but in years he hardly shared any of his painful experiences with his family.His wife, ‘Makhabo, recalls he hardly visited his family when he was working in the mines, and when he did, he used to drench the visit with alcohol and abusive behaviour.\"I suspect that it was the tragic accidents that he witnessed in the mines that pushed him into being a heavy drinker, maybe he wanted to block out the dramatic experiences from his head\", she tells Euronews. \"Mines paid good money for people who were not educated, and back then miners were the envy of all their peers and parents\".A few weeks after recording this interview, Motoana Tlali died of pneumonia at 68. Lung diseases are common among those who worked in mines.He leaves behind his wife, four sons, and two daughters.Despite the tragic life of his father, one of his sons - Tlali Benedict Tlali - still wishes to follow in his father’s footsteps and one day be employed in South African mines. Just like him, he thinks working underground is the only way he can escape poverty for good and best provide for his family.This programme was funded by the European Journalism Centre, through the European Development Journalism Grants programme.

For example, we only hear about miners - men and women who would stop at nothing to feed their families - when something catastrophic happens underground.But have you ever wondered how these people feel? What kind of pressure do they have to face on a daily basis? And, most importantly, what are the consequences for the families left behind, when their breadwinner is willing to do whatever it takes to put bread on the table?As part of its Cry Like a Boy series, Euronews follows up the publication of two exclusive podcast documentaries with this video testimony that sheds a unique light on the plight of Lesotho\\'s mining families.In this video (click ⬆ on the player above) we tell the story of one such family, the Tlali family.The man of the house, Motoana Tlali, dreamt of becoming a businessman but had to give up all his dreams when poverty struck after the death of his father.At 21, he left home for a gold mine in South Africa, where he worked, digging and shoveling, for the next 32 years of his life - hating the underground work \"with every one of my fibres\".Down there, he saw the worst.

Protests all over the world took place, urging world leaders to do more to tackle the climate crisis.\"We are taking to the streets across the world this weekend to push governments from climate inaction to climate justice,\" said Asad Rehman, a spokesperson for the COP Coalition.Here are five key takeaways from day six of the UN climate conference, which was also Nature Day:An estimated 100,000 protesters braved torrential rain in Glasgow on Saturday to take part in worldwide demonstrations against climate inaction at COP26, according to organisers.The giant rally came after tens of thousands of young people took to the streets of Glasgow on Friday to denounce inaction and greenwashing at the global climate summit.\"Our world is under attack, stand up fight back,\" they chanted.\"We\\'re clear that warm words are not good enough - and that the next week of talks must see a serious ramping up of concrete plans,\" said Scottish activist Mikaela Loach at the protest.Jill Bird, a 66-year old came all the way from Bristol to ask rich countries to live up to their promise of providing $100 billion (€86 billion) annually to developing nations.It \"keeps being promised and promised and promised and doesn\\'t actually materialise,\" she said.Security was ramped up in Glasgow and many city-centre shops closed for Saturday\\'s march.However, the action on Saturday did not just unfold in Glasgow but across continents.From Sydney to Paris, including Istanbul, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets all over the world this Saturday.Organisers said over 250 events took place around the world, in addition to a digital global rally.Australia kicked off a series of global climate marches, with protesters in Sydney and Melbourne dressed as lumps of coal or Prime Minister Scott Morrison, a vigorous defender of the mining industry.They labelled the talks as \"a sham\" and their national leader \"an absolute embarrassment.\"In London, about 1,000 people gathered in iconic locations, from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square. Some placards read: \"Less talk more action\" and \"No More COP outs.\"In Paris, hundreds of people rallied in front of the Paris City Hall, carrying a giant banner reading, \"Climate inaction = crimes against the living.\"Protesters also hung a sign to the Olympic rings adorning the city hall that said, \"Inactive at C026: Dying in 2050.\"There were also protests in the Global South, including in the Philippines.Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg\\'s comment on Friday that COP26 was a \"failure\" has grabbed media headlines all over the world.But some say it\\'s too early to rush to judgement about the multilateral talks.\"COP26 has barely started,\" tweeted Michael Mann, director of Penn State\\'s Earth System Science Center. \"Activists declaring it dead on arrival makes fossil fuel executives jump for joy.\"\"Let\\'s call out bad actors, speak truth to power and not allow politicians to make empty promises,\" the expert said.\"But let\\'s NOT throw out the baby with the bathwater. The COP process is the only viable multilateral vehicle we have right now for global climate action,\" he added.Today was Nature Day and the summit turned its focus to issues such as land use and sustainable agriculture.British actor Idris Elba used his star power to draw attention to the role of small-scale farmers, who produce 80 per cent of the food consumed worldwide.\"One day, we\\'ll go to Sainsbury\\'s or Marks & Spencer and food will not be there,\" he warned at a UN event on sustainable agriculture.To those who were wondering why he was taking part, Elba, who is a UN Goodwill Ambassador, said it was because \"this conversation around food is something that needs to be really amplified, and one thing I’ve got is a big mouth.\"\"The supply chain is going to be damaged if we don\\'t figure out what to do,\" Elba insisted.Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate, 24 told the panel climate change was already causing hunger for millions around the world, including in her own country.She said a shift from meat to plant-based diets could help save millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year, while freeing up more land that’s currently used for animal feed.A coalition of 45 countries pledged on Saturday \"urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming,\" the UK COP26 presidency has said.About one-quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, forestry and other land-use, the statement noted, highlighting the urgency to act for more sustainable food systems.The pledge included a commitment to \"leveraging over US$4bn billion of new public sector investment into agricultural innovation,\" according to the statement.An environmental group welcomed the pledge but urged more nations to join the coalition.\"We cannot phase out food, like we can fossil fuels and therefore we welcome the Policy Action Agenda for transition to sustainable food and agriculture,\" said Joao Campari, Global Food Practise Leader at WWF.“Now we need all countries to endorse this action agenda and utilise the action plan,\" he added.Share this articleCOP26 action wasn\\'t just unfolding in host city Glasgow today, but across continents.

At least one pedestrian bridge had to be closed for traffic.Heavy rain also submerged a number of local and regional roads, cutting off traffic and threatening to destroy buildings along the riverbanks.By Saturday, the rising levels of the Bosna river — which flows northwards from Sarajevo — blocked traffic and destroyed vehicles in the city of Zenica and the towns of Visoko, Kakanj, and Breza.The floods have also caused significant damage to local businesses and agricultural farms. In the town of Trnovo, about 30 kilometres south of Sarajevo, one sheep farm owner lost his entire stock overnight, local TV station N1 reported.With homes and roads imperiled in some municipalities, local schools also cancelled classes.A residential care home for the elderly and a plant filling oxygen tanks for hospitals treating COVID-19 patients were also evacuated.Forecasts say that the rainfall is expected to continue until Sunday, with projections of further rain to continue again on Monday.The water levels of some rivers have reached or surpassed those recorded in May 2014, when the country experienced destructive flooding, forcing the authorities to declare a weeks-long state of emergency.The floods in 2014 caused 21 casualties, with two people still declared missing to this day. Thousands had to be evacuated, while the damage to property, infrastructure, and agricultural goods was estimated at around several billion euros.One major consequence of the 2014 floods was the shift in the soil in areas with landmines remaining from the 1992-1995 war in the country, changing the previously mapped-out locations or bringing them closer to densely inhabited areas.Vjekoslav Bevanda, state-level prime minister at the time, claimed that the damage to the country\\'s economy amounted to about 15 per cent of Bosnia\\'s GDP.But little was done since 2014 to prepare for future flooding, especially since projections show that this might become a more common occurrence in the future due to climate change, says Mirza Novokmet, a natural disaster analyst.\"Heavy rain showers have been intensifying in the last couple of decades, and especially the last couple of years,\" he said.\"As we observed in the past few months in Germany, Italy and the Balkans, the amount of rain that usually falls averagely in a couple of months or more, now falls in a single event that could last anywhere between a few minutes up to a few hours or days.\"\"I think people still have the 2014 floods fresh in their memory, and to the people, it’s not unexpected,\" Novokmet stated.\"But the country didn’t do anything major to at least to mitigate some future flood events or the catastrophic consequences of these floods.\"\"They didn’t take it seriously. They kind of view it as something that will pass, that’s not going to be as catastrophic as the big floods in 2014,\" he explains.While local authorities in Bosnia have borne the brunt of criticism for what is seen as an inadequate response by the citizens, Novokmet thinks that the responsibility lies with the country\\'s top political leaders.\"Local communities have their own responsibility — for example, even a single household has their own responsibility to implement some measures.\"\"But these plans are usually made at the top level of government, or in the case of Bosnia, the cantonal or the entity level. I think that the coordination between all of the levels is missing. And the citizens are the worst off because they are the most vulnerable,\" he explained.Bosnia has one of the most complicated systems of government in the world, a legacy of the 1995 peace deal struck to end the war in the country, designed to equally distribute power between its ethnic groups.It saw Bosnia divided into two entities or subnational units, the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The northeastern town of Brčko was declared a district, a separate and distinct administrative unit.Each entity has its own assembly and government, overseen by a state-level parliament and council of ministers. The entity of the Federation of BiH is further divided into ten cantons, each with its own government.Although handling natural disasters and other emergencies is supposed to be done mainly at the entity level, the 14 respective governments, each with varying degrees of responsibility, make up a dizzying maze of blame-shifting and slow decision-making, Novokmet believes.\"In Bosnia, you shift the responsibility from one instance to another in order to avoid taking any responsibility,\" he explains.\"If you point your finger at somebody, they can say, ‘Oh, it’s not our responsibility, you can talk to the cantonal level, to the entity level, the state level,\\' or even claim it\\'s out of their hands because climate change is a global problem, and it’s down to the big countries like Russia, China, Western Europe, the US.\"\"I think that’s the main problem — if nobody can be blamed for it, nobody can bear the consequences,\" Novokmet concluded.Share this articleShare this articleFlash flooding due to sudden heavy rainfall in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina caused evacuations and significant property damage, sparking fears that there could be a repeat of the destruction that swept one-third of the country in 2014.Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes on Friday in the Sarajevo suburbs of Otes and Rajlovac and in the city of Konjic, some 50 kilometers further south.The rising water levels are a result of heavy rainfall that has been uninterrupted since late Thursday, causing problems in municipalities mostly within the proximity of the Bosna and Neretva rivers and their tributaries.The flooding caused a number of electrical substations to malfunction, leaving a large part of the capital\\'s outskirts without power.Residents of the most affected neighborhoods, such as Otes, Vojkovići, and Rajlovac, have since remained off the grid.Local outlets and social media users reported that the Miljacka river, which flows down the middle of the Bosnian capital, also reached unprecedented levels by Friday.

Pew notes that women would have had to work an extra 42 days to earn what men did in 2020, based on this estimate.For its 2021 Best States rankings, U.S. News determined which states have the smallest income gap by gender by analyzing 2019 American Community Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau.These states made the top 10 for income equality by gender:\\n\\n10. Connecticut\\nWomen&#39;s pay as a percentage of men&#39;s pay: 83.7%Connecticut ranks in the bottom 10 for the Opportunity category overall but is buoyed by its better-than-average income equality percentage and poverty rate.Learn more about Connecticut.\\n\\n9. Alaska\\nWomen&#39;s pay as a percentage of men&#39;s pay: 84.5%Alaska ranks in the top 10 for the economic opportunity subcategory, with a median household income ($75,463) nearly $10,000 higher than the national average.Learn more about Alaska.\\n\\n8.

       "'By MARÍA VERZA, Associated PressMEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion, unanimously annulling several provisions of a law from Coahuila — a state on the Texas border — that had made abortion a criminal act.The decision will immediately affect only the northern border state, but it establishes a historic precedent and “obligatory criteria for all of the country’s judges,” compelling them to act the same way in similar cases, said court President Arturo Zaldívar. “From now on you will not be able to, without violating the court\\'s criteria and the constitution, charge any woman who aborts under the circumstances this court has ruled as valid.”Those circumstances will be clarified when the decision is published, but everything points to that referring to abortions carried out within the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy, the period allowed in the four states where abortion is already legal.The decision comes one week after a Texas law took effect prohibiting abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity in the fetus. It allows any private citizen to sue Texas abortion providers who violate the law, as well as anyone who “aids or abets” a woman getting the procedure.Only four Mexican states — Mexico City, Oaxaca, Veracruz and Hidalgo — now allow abortion in most circumstances. The other 28 states penalize abortion with some exceptions.Lawyer and activist Verónica Cruz, director of the collective “Las Libres,” or “The Free,” said the decision “tears down barriers” by sending the message that women cannot be charged for abortions.There are currently no women imprisoned for abortions in Mexico, but there are some 4,600 open investigations for it, said Cruz, whose organization freed the last women who had been in prison for it.Cruz believes the feminist movement will have to maintain pressure on state legislatures to change their laws, because as long as they exist someone will be trying to punish a woman.“In Mexico, we don\\'t have any chance of legalizing nor decriminalizing in one go. It has to be state by state,” Cruz said. That is why activists have been working in one coordinated strategy to force change region by region, he said, to corner the politicians so that “there\\'s no way not to legislate” because it would be “politically incorrect to not eliminate the crime of abortion.\"Mexico is a heavily Roman Catholic country. The church was a powerful institution through colonial times and after Mexico’s independence, but a reform movement in the mid-19th century sharply limited the church’s role in daily life. Anticlerical efforts at times led to bloodshed, especially during the Cristero Rebellion from 1926 to 1929.The topic still remains controversial in Mexico, however. The divide was on display Tuesday as groups from both sides demonstrated outside the court.“We\\'re seen as a Catholic people, as a Guadalupano people,” said law professor Leticia Bonifaz of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “But if you notice today, the issue being discussed is legal, not religious, not moral.”Bonifaz said this Supreme Court is more liberal than the one that decriminalized abortion in Mexico City in 2007. In the intervening years, there has been extensive education for not only the justices, but the lawyers who make up their teams from the perspectives of gender and human rights, she said.For a long time, significant changes for Mexican society were ushered through the legislative branch, but more recently the “Mexican justice system has been a vanguard justice system on many issues,” Bonifaz said.The historic case seemed to leap into the public’s consciousness overnight, but in reality it had been moving through the legal system for four years, said Bonifaz. Former Attorney General Raúl Cervantes had challenged its constitutionality before stepping down in 2017.In previous decisions, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of women who had been imprisoned or had their rights violated for abortions. But Rebecca Ramos, director of the nongovernmental reproductive rights group GIRE, said the latest case was the first time the justices debated the fundamental question of whether abortion should be considered a crime or not.The decision “is a reflection of the historic fight of the feminist movement for legal, safe and free abortion,” GIRE said in a statement. “We hope that in the whole country women and people with the capacity to become pregnant have the conditions and the freedom to decide their reproductive destiny.”Justice Margarita Ríos Farjat criticized those who she said trample on women\\'s rights under the banner of “pro-life.” She said women are labelled “ignorant” and “bad or egotistical, because good women complete the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption.\"Ramos believes the decision will also lead state legislatures where abortion remains a crime to review their laws before facing legal action.The decision could potentially open another option for Texas women seeking legal abortions. For years, some women in south Texas have crossed the border to go to Mexican pharmacies to buy misoprostol, a pill that makes up half of the two-drug combination prescribed for medical abortions.Legal abortions could become accessible now along Mexico\\'s long shared border with Texas.Justice Luis María Aguilar said, “Today banishes the threat of prison and the stigma that weighs on people who freely decide to end their pregnancy.”___Associated Press writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.Copyright 2021 The&nbsp;Associated Press.

But if its essence prevails, Spain would join a handful of countries around the world enshrining gender self-determination without a diagnosis of gender dysphoria or requiring that a person\\'s physical appearance conform with traditional male or female expressions.It would also make the changes in the official registry faster than in most countries: up to four months from the first application to the change finally appearing in official documents. The process would be easily reversible for half a year, but it would require going to court after that.The legal proposal has been controversial from the start, pitting against each other transgender rights activists and some feminists who believe that the law blurs the concept of biological sex.It had also opened an internal battle within the left-wing ruling coalition, with the leading Socialists initially opposing self-determination in line with historical feminist activists while the junior partner of the governing alliance, the far-left United We Can party, strongly pushed for the free, unsupervised right to choose one\\'s gender to prevail.Negotiations within the Cabinet were “long and difficult,” Irene Montero, Equality Minister and a prominent leader of United We Can said Tuesday. But the final draft, she added, was “a giant\\'s step\" in guaranteeing the rights of the LGBT community.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Socialist, said that the draft law put Spain “at the international forefront” in LGBT rights.“We recognize the right of everyone to be whoever they want to be,” he wrote.According to the draft, all Spanish nationals above 16 will be able to change their gender and name by simply stating twice their desire to do so. Previously, applicants needed a gender dysphoria diagnosis by several doctors and, in some cases, proof that they had been living for two years as the gender they identified with — or even records showing they had taken hormones.Teenagers between 14 and 16 can also apply with parental permission or by going to a judge if there is disagreement among them. A court is involved in applications for those between 12 and 14, and children under 12 are only allowed to register a new name but not to change their gender.Transgender rights groups had put pressure for months on the government by holding hunger strikes, proposing more ambitious drafts to Parliament and urging organizers of the country\\'s biggest Pride celebration, in Madrid, to exclude the Socialists from the annual march.Mar Cambrollé, from Plataforma Trans, said Tuesday that while the proposal accepts their demand for self-determination, it falls short in protecting transgender children under 14 or guaranteeing the rights of non-binary people and transgender migrants.“It’s a brutal trim from of what we had demanded for decades,” the veteran activist told The Associated Press. “It does not develop specific policies to deal with unemployment of trans people, it does not delve into protocols for preventing harassment in educational centers, it does not speak of a health care model for us and it does not touch on sports.”Natalia Aventín, head of the Euforia group of families with transgender members, said that transgender rights had been watered-down because the government included them as part of broader legislation in favor of lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer communities.“The government’s marketing campaign has been better than the law itself,” Aventín said.Copyright 2021 The&nbsp;Associated Press.

Alix Dobkin of Woodstock, New York, was 80.An early leader in the music scene for lesbians and women, she passed away at her home from a brain aneurysm and stroke, according to Liza Cowen, her friend and former partner.“Everything that she did was about being a public lesbian in the world,” said Cowen, who also took the striking photo.In 1973, Dobkin formed the group Lavender Jane with musician Kay Gardner. With an all-women team of musicians, engineers and even vinyl pressers, they recorded the album “Lavender Jane Loves Women” — the first ever to be entirely produced by women, Cowen said.Dobkin had been performing in the folk music scene in Philadelphia and New York in the 1960s, where she mingled with future superstars like Bob Dylan, according to her 2009 memoir “My Red Blood.” The title references her parents\\' and her own membership in the Communist party.When she came out as a lesbian, she forged ahead musically as an early leader and then mainstay of Women\\'s Music, a genre made by, for and about women. The genre fostered a whole network of publications, recording labels, venues and festivals starting in the 1970s.“She became an iconic, kind of bigger-than-life figure for women who identified as lesbians,” said Eileen M. Hayes, author of the book \"Songs in Black and Lavender,\" a history of Black women’s involvement in the movement.Dobkin sang songs like “Lesbian Code,” that playfully lists the many ways women interested in women identify each other. She also had a version of the alphabet song that begins, “A, you’re an Amazon.” Dobkin, who was Jewish, often played Yiddish songs during her performances and told stories she had heard growing up in Philadelphia.She often performed for all-women audiences. An undated flyer advertising one of Dobkin’s shows explained all-women concerts offered women the opportunity “to come together to develop our culture as part of the process of taking control of our lives.” It asked men who supported the struggle against sexism not to attend.A friend and collaborator, Kathy Munzer, produced shows for lesbians in Chicago for more than 30 years and called Dobkin “The Head Lesbian,” saying in a Facebook post that she inspired others to take pride in who they were.Before the AIDS epidemic, lesbian and gay organizations operated separately, Hayes said. A prominent women\\'s festival where Dobkin played for years, the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, excluded transwomen from attending. In 2000, Dobkin wrote in defense of cis-women-only spaces while also seeking out conversations with transwomen and defending the right of everyone to love and be themselves.“I especially worry about the narrowing of women’s identity and the erasure of women’s history. For voicing these considerations we have been attacked as ‘bigoted,’ ‘transphobic’ and worse, but are these not credible concerns?” she wrote in a column in the Windy City Times.Reflecting on the fight about cis-women-only spaces, Hayes said at the beginning of the women\\'s movement, “it was a statement about, who is this movement supposed to benefit the most?”The choice to create a parallel media ecosystem also reflected how difficult it was for women to break into the mainstream music industry, Hayes said.“It didn’t support women as performers, and singers, and engineers and advertising people,\" Hayes said. \"It’s still very hard for women to break into the industry.”Hayes called the newfound fame of the slogan “The Future is Female” and the reemergence of the photo of Dobkin “fabulous.”The slogan originated from a woman’s bookstore in New York, Labyris Books, that had screenprinted a small run of the shirts, Cowen said. She photographed Dobkin wearing one for an article she was writing about lesbian fashion. An Instagram post in 2015 by @h_e_r_s_t_o_r_y, an account that chronicles lesbian history, featured the image. That inspired an unaffiliated company to print the T-shirts again and eventually introduced the slogan to a new generation, according to the New York Times.“What we’ve learned through the women’s movement is that, yeah, the future is female, but it’s not a uni-dimensional female,\" Hayes said. “It’s a female identity that is constructed with various threads, various backgrounds, and that is the corrective our new generation makes to the failings of earlier generations.”In the weeks before her death, Dobkin\\'s family kept a public diary about her health that drew hundreds of comments from friends and fans. They wrote of how Dobkin\\'s music provided them comfort, guidance and community.“And still you bring us together again, wonderous woman you are!!!” read one comment.Before coming out as a lesbian, Dobkin married Sam Hood, whose father owned a folk music venue in New York where she had played. Dobkin is survived by him, their daughter, Adrian, and three grandchildren, among other family members, former partners and fans.As a historian and witness to the women\\'s movement, Hayes said she was grateful to have had Dobkin\\'s musical and political leadership.“I think that the death of Alix Dobkin just reminds us of how far we’ve come in terms of LGBTQ right to life,\" she said. \"And right to life as in the right to be.”Copyright 2021 The&nbsp;Associated Press.

So it is not surprising that her most recent book, “The Soul of a Woman,” arrived in the United States during Women’s History Month, just days before the premiere of a miniseries about her life on HBO Max.In her first nonfiction book in more than a decade, the Chilean author reviews her relationship with feminism, remembering those who marked her — from her mother, Panchita, and her daughter Paula to literary agent Carmen Balcells and authors Virginia Woolf and Margaret Atwood. She also reflects on the #MeToo movement, unrest in Chile and the coronavirus pandemic.“The year of the pandemic has paralyzed everything, and much of what women had done was going out to the streets to gather and protest,” said Allende in an interview with The Associated Press via Zoom from her home in California. “Women alone are very vulnerable, women together are invincible... It’s not that I think that it has regressed or stopped. This is moving forward.”The first 50 years of her life are dramatized in “Isabel: The Intimate Story of the Writer Isabel Allende,” a three-part biopic premiering Friday on HBO Max starring Chilean actress Daniela Ramírez.Produced by Megamedia Chile and directed by Rodrigo Bazaes, the miniseries bookends the story with the death of her daughter, who died in 1992 at 29 while in a coma due to a porphyria crisis (as Allende wrote in her 1994 memoir “Paula”).“It made me sob because it starts with Paula in the hospital and ends with Paula’s death. We saw it with my son (Nicolás) and we both had to stop because we were crying so hard with the first scene. But then it gets better in the sense that it is no longer so emotional for us,” she said, adding that she was extremely pleased and impressed with the result.Allende starts a new book every January 8th. Last year, quarantine allowed her to finish not one but two: “The Soul of a Woman,” a Ballantine Books release, and an upcoming novel titled “Violeta” that begins with the 1918 pandemic (“which really began in Chile in 1920,” she points out) and ends with today\\'s pandemic. “It is the life of a woman during that time,” she says.Allende recalled her beginnings as a feminist and also spoke about her experience as a 78-year-old “newlywed” in confinement. She married her third husband, New York lawyer Roger Cukras, in July 2019.Answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.AP: You have said that you were bothered by injustices against women from an early age and that it was something you got to see in your own family. But when and how did you realize that you were a feminist?Allende: Darling, there was no such a word back then! When I was a girl in Chile in the 40s, in a conservative, Catholic, patriarchal family, my mother had been abandoned by her husband and we lived in my grandfather’s house. All men, my uncles and my grandfather. And my grandfather was the absolute patriarch. He was a very good man, I adored him, but he was the highest authority, he was like God. What my grandfather said was not questioned. I grew up with the feeling that my mother was in a situation of injustice, in a situation of inequality, of vulnerability. My mother lived in the same house and I suppose my grandfather paid for school and all that, but my mother never had money, she never had freedom. Being a separated woman at that time, in that society, my mother was very frowned upon; she had to take great care of her reputation, for which she was also very limited. And when did I come to realize that this anger that I felt had a name? It was not, I think, until adolescence, because there were no references. And I couldn’t realize that there really was a movement, and that I could belong to that movement, until I was 20 at least.AP: And did you feel liberated or accompanied in any way? How do you remember it?Allende: I remember when I read “The Female Eunuch” (1970) by Germaine Greer, which was a book with humor, with intelligence, with a way of saying things that was so direct and so obvious. I was feeling all those feelings, but I had not expressed them, I did not know how to articulate them, until I read that book.AP: “The Soul of a Woman” is your first nonfiction book in more than a decade. What led you to write it now?Allende: It wasn’t my idea. I gave a speech in Mexico City a while ago and the speech was a viral phenomenon. The publishers in Spain thought they were going to publish it as a little book. I read it and said, “This thing is totally outdated,” because in a short time #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, the protests of women in the street... so much had happened that was not mentioned in the speech. I said, “No, this is useless.” Then I started to think about my own trajectory and how I have lived the movement, because it has been almost simultaneous, you see? The women’s liberation movement is very old, but it really began with the pill in the 1960s, when women were able to control their fertility for the first time. That created a space that didn’t exist before, a space that my mother of course did not have — my mother was married for four years and had three children.AP: You started writing it just as we were starting to lock ourselves up because of the pandemic. What do you hope will happen now with the women’s movement?Allende: The year of the pandemic has had everything paralyzed, but things continue to move forward. And feminism has joined other movements that are also on the streets, like Black Lives Matter, which is a subversion against the establishment, against a racist system. That same system, a chauvinist system, is what gives the male gender supremacy over other women, over other races, over people who have no power, over children. When we challenge the power of the establishment, we have so much in common that we can do it together. We have arrived to a moment were we must shake up the society we live in and try to establish a different, more sustainable, more just and better new normal for ourselves, for everybody.AP: How has the pandemic treated you?Allende: Well, because what a writer needs is time, silence and solitude, and the pandemic has given me that. I’m a newlywed and look, the pandemic has been a litmus test because it’s like a long honeymoon that never ends (laughs). But in this honeymoon we have learned a lot as a couple, as a family, that can be extrapolated to humanity: We are forced to live on a fragile planet, in a limited space that has to be sustainable, that we have to keep in order and clean, otherwise we will perish. That we need patience, tolerance, compassion, kindness.AP: How do you feel about the biopic?Allende: The only thing I asked of them is to respect the other people who appear in the series, because look, I have written memories about my own life, I’ve been a bit of a chatterbox so I don’t have the right to claim privacy. But the people around me who have private lives, you have to be respectful with them; those stories don’t belong to me. But they (the producers) did a good job, because they respected my ex-husband, my children. I really liked the end result.___Follow Sigal Ratner-Arias on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sigalratner.Copyright 2021 The&nbsp;Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Collectively, they\\'re seeking to increase funding to organizations for Black girls and feminists and to enhance economic opportunities for Black women.Goldman Sachs plans to tailor its investments to education and workforce advancement, among other needs. Two other funds are still assessing how they will disseminate their grants.Statistics show that organizations for Black women have been disproportionately neglected by foundations. In 2017, one of the latest years for which comprehensive data is available, less than 1% of the $67 billion that foundations contributed went to organizations that specifically target minority women and girls, according to a report from the Ms Foundation for Women and the consulting group Strength in Numbers. Less than $15 million was specified as benefiting Black women and girls.Those findings helped launch the Black Girl Freedom Fund, established in September by eight Black women in philanthropy and activism, including Tarana Burke, who is credited with starting the Me Too movement. Its first campaign is 1Billion4BlackGirls, which calls for $1 billion in contributions earmarked for Black girls over the next decade.Co-founder Monique Morris, who also leads the philanthropic organization Grantmakers for Girls of Color, says it wants to have the $1 billion in contributions come from across the philanthropic community. The Black Girl Freedom Fund will seek to support legal advocacy and fight against what it calls \"structural violence enacted against Black girls.”As part of this effort, the fund partnered with Shondaland, a television production company, for a December episode of the show “Grey’s Anatomy.” The episode portrayed two Black girls being kidnapped by a human trafficker, reflecting a social problem the fund wanted to address: A report from the U.S. Justice Department that analyzed suspected human trafficking from 2008 to 2010, found that the overwhelming majority of sex trafficking victims were women and 40% were Black.The singer Ciara made a sizable contribution to the fund, Morris said. Support came, too, from other celebrities, including actors Gabrielle Union and Rashida Jones, and from Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama.A study released in December by Indiana University’s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy showed that while donations to organizations involved with women and girls are increasing, they still represent less than 2% of charitable giving. Teresa Younger, president of the Ms Foundation for Women and a co-founder of the Black Girl Freedom fund, suggests that the meager funding has reflected \"a lack of interest in philanthropy in truly investing in those organizations.”Black women and girls do, of course, benefit from many nonprofits and charities, even when such contributions are not earmarked specifically for them. But Younger suggested that donors shouldn\\'t assume that this is occurring. That’s why she thinks establishing a fund that focuses entirely on that demographic is important.“One of the things that we know is: If you don’t name it, then it’s not happening,” she said.The barriers to accessing foundation funds range from an organization’s inability to find grants relevant to the work they do to unresponsive donors to excessive paperwork that gets in the way of securing contributions.“We know that Black women and Black women’s organizations often get very little funding in the global landscape, but Black feminists, and women that are prepared to come out explicitly as being feminist, are severely marginalized,” said Nicolette Naylor, the Ford Foundation’s international program director for gender, racial and ethnic justice.The foundation is backing the Black Feminist Fund, which it has helped launch with a $15 million contribution. That fund will be led by activists from across the African diaspora, and according to the foundation, will serve as “the first global resource hub for Black feminist organizing and philanthropy.”One of its co-founders, Tynesha McHarris, said the goals include ending violence against Black women, supporting young Black feminists and advocating resource rights around things like land, water and food.Separately, Goldman Sachs in March committed $10 billion over the next decade to an initiative to improve the lives of 1 million Black women by 2030. Most of the money is slated to be spent on Black women-focused investments, in areas like health and job creation, with $100 million earmarked for philanthropy.That announcement coincided with the release of a report from the bank called Black Womenomics, which focuses on the racial wealth gap and the need to seek economic equity for Black women. This is happening even while Goldman, and others like JPMorgan Chase, are asking shareholders to reject a proposal by the Service Employees International Union, a labor union, and the CtW Investment Group for an independent review of how the banks\\' lending practices and other policies have affected racial equity.“Over the past year,\" Goldman said in its annual shareholders statement, “we have further strengthened our established racial-equity related initiatives and taken new actions to encourage open dialogue, assess our shortcomings and enhance our diversity and inclusion efforts to create lasting change both at our firm and within our communities. In light of our ongoing commitment to these important issues, we believe that the adoption of this proposal is unnecessary and therefore not in the best interest of our firm or our shareholders.”Since last year\\'s protests, corporations have emerged as the leading financiers of racial equity. Yet it remains unclear where $3.9 billion out of the $8.9 billion they’ve collectively pledged to racial equity causes is going, according to preliminary data from the philanthropy research organization Candid.Goldman Sachs is holding “listening tours” with Black women before making any investments or donations, said Asahi Pompey, head of the bank’s foundation. She said Goldman wants to be “expeditious” but also strategic in its decisions. There’s no timeline for when the $100 million it has pledged in contributions will begin to be distributed. But Pompey said the bank plans to issue periodic reports about its progress.Black Americans have been disproportionately hurt economically by the pandemic recession. And though they represent less than one-third of the female labor force in the U.S., Black and Hispanic women have accounted for 46% of the decline in labor force participation among women during the pandemic, according to the Pew Research Center.Naylor, of the Ford Foundation, said that while the launch of the Black Feminist Fund was spurred by the protests, conversations about it had been taking place since 2013. Once fully established, the fund plans to make grants to grassroots Black feminist organizations in Africa, the Americas and Europe.Its three founders are seeking $100 million in donations from all donors in the first year. But ultimately, they’re aiming for the fund to be sustained by donors who are Black women. One core principle, McHarris said, is “self-determination.”Similarly, the Black Girl Freedom Fund’s 1Billion4BlackGirls campaign has a $100 million goal for its first year. So far, the fund has received $15.9 million in contributions.Morris said the fund plans to announce two major gifts in the coming weeks that, along with investments and contributions from other foundations, will put it on track to reach its goal by September. Decisions on what organizations will receive the first set of grants from the fund will be made in June.——The Associated Press receives support from the Lilly Endowment for coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits.

Human rights groups linked her prosecution to the Kremlin’s conservative stance promoting “traditional family values.”The charges against activist Yulia Tsvetkova, 27, in the far eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur have brought international outrage. She faces up to six years in prison on charges reportedly related to her group on the popular Russian social media network VKontakte, where stylized drawings of vaginas were posted. Tsvetkova is not allowed to disclose details of the criminal case against her.The hearing comes a year and a half after she was first detained and eight months after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed constitutional amendments that outlawed same-sex marriage and tasked the government with “preserving traditional family values.”Tsvetkova\\'s lawyer, Irina Ruchko, told reporters after the hearing that she maintains her innocence and the defense intends to prove it in court.Tsvetkova ran a children’s theater and was a vocal advocate of feminism and LGBT rights. She founded an online group called Vagina Monologues that encouraged followers to fight the stigma and taboos surrounding the female body, and posted other people’s art in it.Amnesty International last week called the case, which is being heard behind closed doors, “Kafkaesque absurdity” and urged Russian authorities to drop all charges. It said Tsvetkova was merely “expressing her views through art.”Tsvetkova’s mother, Anna Khodyreva, echoed this sentiment in an interview with The Associated Press.“Yulia has always been against pornography. … Feminists are against pornography because it’s exploitation of women’s bodies,” she said.Tsvetkova was detained in November 2019 and spent the next four months under house arrest. Her home was raided, along with her mother\\'s education studio for children.The activist was fined twice for violating Russia’s law against disseminating gay “propaganda” to minors. The court ordered Tsvetkova to pay a fine of 50,000 rubles ($780) in December 2019 for running an LGBT-themed online group, and 75,000 rubles ($1,060) in July 2020 for a drawing in support of LGBT families. The second fine was later decreased to 50,000 rubles.Many public figures have spoken out in her support, including Russian state TV veteran Vladimir Pozner. Activists across Russia have protested her prosecution, artists dedicated performances to her and an online petition demanding that the charges be dropped gathered over 250,000 signatures.On Saturday, an exhibition of Tsvetkova\\'s paintings opened in St. Petersburg.“The snowball of censorship has started to bother the artistic community very much, and we understood that if we don\\'t stand up for Yulia, don\\'t support her, any other person can be next,” artist Alexei Gorbushin, who organized and took part in performances in Tsvetkova\\'s support, said at the exhibition.The European Union\\'s delegation to Russia tweeted the bloc “is closely following\" the case against Tsvetkova and that “apparently, her persecution is related to her public position as an LGBT activist.\" The delegation called on Russian authorities to stop the prosecution.In addition to pressure from authorities for the past two years, Khodyreva says she and her daughter have received death threats and were repeatedly harassed by strangers. Khodyreva’s education studio for children has lost many clients. Tsvetkova’s children’s theater, Merak, no longer exists — frequent visits from law enforcement were too distressing for the children so it shut down, Khodyreva said.“It is terrifying. I’m still looking back at the door even now,” Khodyreva told the AP. “The police have barged in so many times that … I’m not ready to have the children involved in this mayhem.”Tsvetkova’s troubles started when the children’s theater was preparing to show a play about gender stereotypes, titled “The Blues and the Pinks,” in March 2019 at a theater festival she organized.The festival lost two venues it found, Khodyreva said, and police questioned children involved in the play about whether Tsvetkova, who directed it, talked to them about LGBT issues. The play had nothing to do with LGBT issues — the name referred to colors traditionally associated with boys and girls — but in the 1990s, “blue” and “pink” in Russian were popular colloquialisms for gay men and women.According to Khodyreva, police didn’t talk to the children’s parents, many of whom supported her and her daughter, and the contacts with police were traumatic for the theater’s young students.“We saw how bad the children felt. We saw how the boy who came up with the name for the play cried, thinking it was his fault,” Khodyreva said, adding that another boy who worried that he’d told police something about her daughter cried.Tsvetkova was repeatedly summoned for interrogations. In March 2019, the activist said she was questioned about a series of her drawings called “A Woman is Not a Doll.” The cartoonish depictions of naked or semi-clad women bore captions such as “Real women have hair on their bodies — and that’s normal,” “Real women have body fat — and that’s normal.” Police alleged the images were pornographic, Tsvetkova said in a VKontakte post.Months later, she was detained and charged with disseminating pornography.Russia\\'s prominent human rights group Memorial has declared Tsvetkova a political prisoner. The group said her persecution was related to “her civic engagement and feminist views she didn\\'t conceal and promoted through absolutely legal means as an activist and a contemporary artist\" and the narrative of defending “traditional values” the Kremlin has embraced in a bid to tighten its grip on power.___Alexander Permyakov in Komsomolsk-on-Amur and Yekaterina Krylova in St. Petersburg contributed to this report.Copyright 2021 The&nbsp;Associated Press.

I was feeling all those feelings, but I had not expressed them, I did not know how to articulate them, until I read that book.AP: “The Soul of a Woman” is your first nonfiction book in more than a decade. What led you to write it now?Allende: It wasn’t my idea. I gave a speech in Mexico City a while ago and the speech was a viral phenomenon. The publishers in Spain thought they were going to publish it as a little book. I read it and said, “This thing is totally outdated,” because in a short time #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, the protests of women in the street... so much had happened that was not mentioned in the speech. I said, “No, this is useless.” Then I started to think about my own trajectory and how I have lived the movement, because it has been almost simultaneous, you see? The women’s liberation movement is very old, but it really began with the pill in the 1960s, when women were able to control their fertility for the first time. That created a space that didn\\'t exist before, a space that my mother of course did not have — my mother was married for four years and had three children.AP: You started writing it just as we were starting to lock ourselves up because of the pandemic. What do you hope will happen now with the women’s movement?Allende: The year of the pandemic has had everything paralyzed, but things continue to move forward. And feminism has joined other movements that are also on the streets, like Black Lives Matter, which is a subversion against the establishment, against a racist system. That same system, a chauvinist system, is what gives the male gender supremacy over other women, over other races, over people who have no power, over children. When we challenge the power of the establishment, we have so much in common that we can do it together. We have arrived to a moment were we must shake up the society we live in and try to establish a different, more sustainable, more just and better new normal for ourselves, for everybody.AP: How has the pandemic treated you?Allende: Well, because what a writer needs is time, silence and solitude, and the pandemic has given me that. I’m a newlywed and look, the pandemic has been a litmus test because it\\'s like a long honeymoon that never ends (laughs). But in this honeymoon we have learned a lot as a couple, as a family, that can be extrapolated to humanity: We are forced to live on a fragile planet, in a limited space that has to be sustainable, that we have to keep in order and clean, otherwise we will perish. That we need patience, tolerance, compassion, kindness. We need enough resources for everyone.AP: How do you feel about the biopic on your life? Have you seen it?Allende: When they told me about the project, I never thought they were going to do it, so I didn’t give it much attention. One day they called me and the thing was practically done. The only thing I asked of them is to respect the other people who appear in the series, because look, I have written memories about my own life, I\\'ve been a bit of a chatterbox so I don\\'t have the right to claim privacy. But the people around me who have private lives, you have to be respectful with them; those stories don’t belong to me. But they (the producers) did a good job, because they respected my ex-husband, my children. I really liked the end result.AP: What did you think of the leading actress? Did you feel well represented?Allende: Daniela Ramírez plays a role that I think it’s very difficult to do, to imitate another person, to try to be the other person. And furthermore we don\\'t look alike; she is a very young and beautiful woman. But look, they even did the hairstyles, the dresses. I have a necklace with silver coins and each of those coins is different, a jeweler made especially for me. They made it identical! And like that, many details — what the house was like, the children ... It is truly thrilling.___Follow Sigal Ratner-Arias on Twitter at https://twitter.com/sigalratner.Copyright 2021 The&nbsp;Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Separately, the George Soros-founded Open Society Foundations and PayPal have each pledged more than $100 million.Jeannie Sager, the director of the Women’s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University, says the litany of announcements promise greater action for gender equality, and adds to the collective urgency the U.N. has championed on the issue. U.N. goals for 2030 include achieving gender equality.The event comes nearly a year after the U.N. commemorated the 25th anniversary of the landmark 1995 Beijing women’s conference. About 190 countries adopted a roadmap at the 1995 event to achieve gender equality but no nation has reached the goal.“The world has been fighting for gender equality for decades, but progress has been slow,” Melinda French Gates said in the Gates Foundation announcement, adding that it was time to “reignite a movement and deliver real change.”Advancing gender equality is a core area for the Seattle-based foundation, the largest private charitable group in the United States with an endowment of nearly $50 billion. It gives about $5 billion annually through its philanthropic work, but it’s future - and leadership structure - have been called into question following Bill and Melinda’s recent divorce.French Gates and Ford Foundation President Darren Walker are scheduled to speak at the three-day Forum. Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke at Wednesday\\'s opening event.Harris told the forum that “addressing gender equity and equality is essential to addressing every other challenge we face, which is certainly true in light of the current threats to democracy.\"“Gender equality strengthens democracy,\" she said in virtual remarks, stressing that U.S. commitments “will yield results -- real, tangible results -- that improve the lives of women in the United States and women around the world.\"___The Associated Press receives support from the Lilly Endowment for coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits.
